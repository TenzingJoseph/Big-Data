I very thankful to my brother who gave me suggestion to buy the electric bike revolt rv400 and now i also suggested to people to buy electric bikes. Thank you."
Rv400 good & bad,1 year ago by Vipin Tyagi,4,"Rv400 is good e-bike we are sharing with you our good and bad experience, bike pickup look like petrol bike, led lamp is give us best vision in night, average is good no daily petrol tension.Bad experience- no central stand, no option for leg guard, siting no comfortable, cover should be on belt, foot rest is not best."
No more fut futt futtt,1 year ago by Mr Smarty Pants,2,"The biggest issue before going electric is range and performance. The bike is below mediocre in both. Stated  range of 100 km is not enough. If we travel 30km to and fro add to it the loss of inefficiency we are staring at 70-80 kms range which would put battery to its limits since stated range is always far fetched. Now lets add realistic assumptions. 1-the sub tropical climate of india with scorching summers of 40+ radically affects battery life and range over years. We are starting at 70% efficiency within 2-3 years at best. Though the decline after initial fall would be slower. Typical reason why most manufacturers prefer liquid cooling for battery. If they don’t for cost savings, stay away for you will pay in future. 2-the battery life also depends on its peak charge and its lower extremity over repeated use. Maintaining a charge of 80% as max would be suitable most of the time and so for downsides of 20% that limits the battery charge usable to 60% for regular days.  60% of 100km - inflated statement (assume 20%) - 2-3 years degradation  We are already staying at range of 40-60 kms depending on individuals driving habits and use case. I would happily pay a premium for electric is performance parameters are atleast at par with regular bikes from range to top-speed. I fully understand the economics under play and rate of returns and current bikes of range 100-150 are not worth it. Add to it their limited to speed and rigidity. Waiting for 4th gen products. Remember what happened with smart phones. We barely recall what first few generations looked like until they are good enough to attract our attention. Till that time let’s enjoy the last of this smoking hot barrels."

Exceptional review,1 year ago by Sridhar,5,"This is simply amazing and exceptionally well and good. The price seems to be little bit high when compare to its features. I have fully satisfied with the stylish in two variant colors. It would be more better if you can add one more gray color. I believe, this going be rocking henceforth step into the market."

Piece of shit. Would highly recommend not to,1 year ago by Alex,1,"I have a rv400  I have the bike for almost more than a year now, never ever the bike gave me an average of more than 70 kms in a single full charge, I hardly get 65 kms on mode 1. Informed the same to the service center, they asked me to swap the battery, done it many times still the problem continues on and on no matter what the bike never gave me an average of more than 70 whereas I ride on mode one itself."
Revolt 400,1 year ago by Simangsha Boro,3,Buying experience of Revolt 400 bike. It is usually in Tamulpur Assam. About looks and performance its good but am looking forward to service and maintenance.
A blessing for daily commuters.,10 months ago by Scripted Tales,5,"We'll, this bike will meet the interests of many Indians, in many factors, excluding a few like riding range and speed. But still, if you're daily riding range is less than 130-120 kms and able to maintain an idle speed of 60 to 70 km/h, then this bike will serve you the best. In terms of braking, combined braking system is provided and it's performing just as much as required. Ergonomics are good, comfort factor is well prioritized by the makers. The bluetooth connectivity is an interesting element which grabs the attention of the youth. Although there are plenty of features on the app which are necessary in the present day, but the throttle sound feature was awesome. That's the feature which makes the bike special when compared to the other ev's in the nation. In terms of electrical vehicles it's worthy to get a new bike as early as possible. The main reason is, governments are encouraging, fuel prices are peaking (even if they get back to normal, prices will rise in the near future), and it's always good to get adapted with the changes. At last this bike provides all the features similar to a 150cc naked bike, apart from the ride range and gearing feel."
Royal revolt,2 years ago by Vishnu Pj,5,"Best bike. It is a royal bike,feels like young and energetic, very comfortable and good safety. My dream: revolt. Revolt is my love. Can silencer change bike.

Value for money  !!!,10 months ago by Pankaj Pamnani,5,Value for money.  Really a thumbs up for the bike as petrol prices have gone up this bike is like a game changer for bike lovers its performance looks and running cost of bike are really impressive and now when government is giving subsidy everyone should change their bike to RV 400.Its simply the best.
Battery protection required,9 months ago by Arjun,4,"Please give protection to the battery, because once my neighbor was searching for his battery, someone stole his battery from parking. There is no protection to the battery given by the company so please understand."
A great bike  but a big problem..............,6 months ago by Dev,4,"First of all , it's a great bike for daily use , you will not have any problem if you are going to use it for traveling daily 30 to 40 kms , but when it comes to weight it is a little more but we have to compromise it to have a great motor power. It was not available for a month near my residence but I got it after 1 month so you can call the supplier and book it 15 days beforehand. The colors are awesome and performance is good , so if you are a adult or able to adjust to a 100kg bike then you should consider it."
Worst customer service,5 months ago by Zuhayr,1,"Very very bad customer service.... Booked revolt 9 months ago!!!! and still have not received the vehicle... And not response from the company.... Called more than 10 times... And no response.... They say it will be delivered the coming week but it has been 9 months and nothing is done and after booking they ask another 15,000 saying it's being upgraded... Not worth the time and effort. Look somewhere else..."
Pathetic response from revolt,4 months ago by Anil,1,Wanna buy this bike so i gave basic information to the company to get response but only fraudsters calls me in the name of revolt for online fraud so there's a data leakage also besides this i've changed my mind to buy this after reading reviews of owners and company response.Pathetic response from revolt.

Horrible and pathetic approch my revolt.,4 months ago by Jillu,1,Absolutely terrible as no one in revolt is responding to the query and the wait till still continues after 7 months? sarcastic and going on booking further orders to accumulate crores and there is no word on the delivery. Customer service never responds to any queries and the dealership is all the more pathetic that they do not just care about the customers and their requests.

Dream bike for youngsters,2 years ago by Gaurav,4,It's a good  and eco friendly bike. Very less maintenance and it's like you are riding normal bike.. You can drive on highway also but company should built-in charging station on at-least main highway and city..Future is for electric bike and go and grab this beauty..Will share more experience in future.
Amazing bike with great features,2 years ago by Debiprasad,4,Revolt bikes are the best budget friendly bike in India in the next 2020.Both the bike revolt 300 and revolt 400 looking great having unique features.For the college students it is the best option.Further may revolt bikes put some more amazing unique sound from its riding experience is different.Great power having great sound.
The new future of bikes or is it  lets find o,2 years ago by Alapan Roy,4,"Well, 1st of all its totally visually appealing. Awesome ergonomics, built quality looks premium.Although it is an electric bike its safer for our environment also, so i congratulate revolt to bring the future in our reach. Now its time for the truth, the most important than any question , is it worth to get one ?? lets find out together.Pros :- 1) its an electric bike (green).2) anyone , even students can afford it with mrp(my revolt plan) scheme.3) looks great. Even built quality also never compromised by revolt.4) high-tech apps features (not all features are disclose as of now, so there should be more premium features letter on ) ex- geo fensing , exhaust sound change , keyless , and riding modes.5) swapping station and battery delivery concept.6) lifetime battery warranty.7) unlimited service by revolt under mrp(my revolt plan).8) though its an electric bike the lower end pick up is heavily high.9) usd(up-side down forks).10) led head drls & projector head lamp.11) led tell lamp.15) fast charging (75% charge in 2.5hour / full charge 4-4.5 hour).16) can be charge at any place with an 15mm port.17) can run up to 150km after one charge.18) cost efficient.Cons:-1) there is no abs.2) lack of speed. (max speed 80km/h)3) weight carrying capacity. (not more than 150kg)4) battery weight is too heavy almost 19-20kg. They said if your bike run out of battery then you can carry the batter charge it and put it back and you good to go. But i don't think it is to carry 20kg.5) it is an electric bike so its initial pick up is very high so you need to be very concerned while rev the acceleration.6) the engine power could be more powerful , overall you making a bike not scooter.(personal opinion).7) bike looks great but very compact which make this look like a toy.8) additional body graphics is missing which i believe can be added.9) the bike has no exhaust sounds, but there is a speaker which produce artificial exhaust sound and it totally understandable that the sound is artificial.Now the questions:-1) should i buy this bike ??Ans :- of course.. I will buy this bike when it will available in my area.2) why ?Ans :- because, not every superhero wear mask.."
Comparison with other similarly placed bikes,2 years ago by Akash Khurana,3,"1. In terms of power and design of the bike, you can compare it with any 150 cc bike available in market like ""pulsar, fz etc."" which ranges from Rs. 70,000 to 90000. However, you would be paying around 1,50,000 for this bike.Plus side - eco friendlyNegative side - twice expensive, Compromise on speed and range2. My Revolt Plan is nothing but a veil of LOAN for this bike from financial institution, ""RattanIndia Finance"" for which you would be paying 18% rate of interest and the same has already been included in My Revolt Plan.Plus side - Zero Down  PaymentNegative side - Compulsion of taking loan and submission of alot of documents and paper work.3. No doubt there are alot of new features being show cased like remote controlled, push start button, operating bike from mobile phone, changing sound, geo fencing. I believe other features like DRLs are quite common features which are available in every bike now a days.At the time of taking the test drive of this bike, i was told that you can only start the bike either from a remote or mobile phone and not from a key. They could not answer when I asked them how to start the bike if remote stopped working and my mobile phone is out of battery.Although, sound coming out from the speaker is an interesting feature, however, maximum sound in itself is not at all loud and thrilling.My overall experience with representatives at Revolt Showroom was very bad as they were neither welcoming nor were aware about the complete specifications of the bike nor could answer to my queries.Cannot say much about the ride quality or performance of the bike because representatives only let me ride the bike in a service lane just for 2-3 minutes.I would give an overall rating of 3 stars to this bike and my overall experience."
Change the ride concept,2 years ago by Abhiraj Barde,5,This  bike is very useful & pollution  free and his feature is a very good like ai system and app control.The bike battery charge power is very good and  mileage is a very very high compare to other electric bike ans this is 1st electric bike in India and company's emi plans is very useful to buyers.
Don't buy revolt,3 weeks ago by Manhesh,1,"Don't buy revolt it's worthless.Worst buying experienceI took a test ride in Pune city and found it a good ev option better than the scooter option.Booked on Nov 21, buy paying 20k as booking amount, got slot of Feb-mar 22. To date didn't receive a bike.They don't have any customer support department or no options to solve customer issues.Their calls didn't get connected before 10min.Even after connecting you will get an answer that your complaint has escalated, and our people will get back to you( which never happens and didn't happen in 7 months).Whatsapp is in pits stop.Mails are only auto replied nothing after it. You will get the same mail each time. No one answers with solutions.If they can't provide bikes to customers on time why do they take advances and give delivery slots."
What an amazing bike,2 years ago by Vishwash Mishra,5,I really enjoyed this bike for city use its perfect bike and you can use it according to you. If you need average you can use low battery consumption mode other than this this bike looks sporty if you ride on the this bike so you will feel that its a sport bike and i like most its sound feature you can also change sound.
Review,2 years ago by Prashant,4,"This is very good bike to ride comfortable also.This bike is very friendly to environment,not produce any of pollution that's why this bike is so successful . The battery backup is also very good my bike giving me above 150 km range with one time full charge and it is easy to charge also.This bike is pollution free,easy to maintain fuel less."
Awesome experience with this bike ...,2 years ago by Varun Prasad,5,"Battery life is good, puck is extraordinarily...I like this bike very much ...No tension of refueling....In city riding it is the best i have ever seen...The special about this bike is 7 year battery makes trusted vehicle. it is the first even electric bike which is capable to defeat modern petrol bike and scooter.."
Still not available at my place hyderabad,2 years ago by Abrar,5,I have seen videos. Revolt rv 400 will sure bring the change in market also in future. I like the futuristic technology anti-theft system gps service. More over the sound system for exhaust but would love to have bluetooth connection to the speakers so can play songs. I will sure buy this bike as it's the gate way to the future.
Looking dashing,2 years ago by Rajeev Kumar Singh,5,"I have not ridden the bike, but looking so good & dashing. I want bike in my home town patna city. Initial cost high but running cost is very low according to petroleum bikes & pollution free to air & sounds. It's natural & renewable type of energy bike specially for men(boys). I am satisfied for both disc brake system."
Really good experience to see rv400,2 years ago by Pawan Kumar,4,I see this bike at kirti nagar delhi industrial area i drive my bike but another rv400 driver overtakes me without any noise this is great experience for me .. I really want to purchase this bike... But cost is very high and bike specifications are clearly mentioned i tried so many times.
Smoother and quick response Pollution free Bi,2 years ago by Arvind K. Singh,4,"I purchased my Bike before 1 week on 37 EMI's, Total cost of 1.5 Lac, Total drive experience of 500 Km. I can say smooth and quick running, very good driving experience, After one full charge of Bike performance are as per below 1. at Max. speed limit of 42 km/Hrs. total range 140 Km., 2. at Max. speed limit of 60 Km/Hrs. total range 95 Km., 3. at Max. speed limit of 80 Km./Hrs. total range 80 Km."
Superb,2 years ago by Kj,4,It looks like a good bike. Dashing look. Mesmerizing. What not to say about it. It is like fz of yamaha. Very good as it is electric vehicle. You can use it .It is little more costly but can be a good option. It should praise your interest towards electric vehicle.
Rv400 good & bad,1 year ago by Vipin Tyagi,4,"Rv400 is good e-bike we are sharing with you our good and bad experience, bike pickup look like petrol bike, led lamp is give us best vision in night, average is good no daily petrol tension.Bad experience- no central stand, no option for leg guard, siting no comfortable, cover should be on belt, foot rest is not best."
Super bike.,1 year ago by Divy,5,It's amazing bike. all type of service are nice. Look is better then all other bike. Pollution free bike and more grater than petrol bikes. RV400 bike is more Features than other Electric bike. It's key is very good. It's remote control bike.
Worst service and spare part availability,5 months ago by Vinay Salke,2,"This bike good for city ride. But this bike have lots of issue like,1. Remote of the bike haves lot cheap quality it have been replaced twice in a year.2. Front suspension is very stiff.3. Service network is worst.4 . Spare part availability is the biggest issue. 5. Service network is very low.6. Staff behavior towards customer is very rude.7. Customer support is very weak.8. Spare part quality is also not good and there failure ratio is too frequently."
Performance,2 years ago by Uday Kr Kashyap,5,"It is a good performance bike ever in electronic bike or scooty in India. All of things, just about its breaking system, damn cool also speed is perfect. Most popular thing is its three mode system, and also the super bike sound system . Thank you revolt. Its all value of money. Lajwab hai."
Review,2 years ago by Laxman Patil,5,"Details about looks, performance etc is very best,this is low buying bike and best riding bike, this servicing and maintenance is better easy. Pros and cons is better and it's maintenance is very easy. This is one of the most super bike and this bike is very shiny and look is  very beautiful ...."
"Poor after sales service, Lack of Availabilit",1 week ago by Harshad,1,"Sales after service are very poor, Many parts are not available in Revolt Showroom, Service associates are helpless and have the same answer that parts are not available every service scheduled. 1st & 2nd service done by giving washing and cleaning by Air compressor only and problem not solved as parts were not available."
Excellent bike - ride of the future,1 year ago by Mini,5,"My daughters wanted me to buy only electric scooter - for the environment they said. So i booked  in august and collected by bike yesterday! riding  the bike is an awesome experience... Smooth and effortless ride.. Only issue is the slightly shady billing and invoicing process - even though i paid 1,68,989/- invoice says 1,39,989! ather is issuing two separate invoices - one for less amount (1,39,000) where they claim fame ii incentive and one more additional invoice of balance amount where they are simply charging claiming some upgrade...Thus effectively the individual don't get the fame incentive!  so according to this ather 450x will be around 1,90,000!"
Very comfortable,3 months ago by Ajit Jain,5,Superb riding experience and its too smooth. Every one should ride the Ather scooter also good mileage and speed on traffic area.
Too much costly and quality wise average.,4 months ago by Shubham Patil,1,"Riding experience is good but the cost wise its very costly also the price mentioned in ""bikewale"" is also wrong, and its range is the second brand killer for Ather 450x with only 85 kms in a single charge. Ather 450x is the costliest electric scooter in India, its on road is 1.65 lakh, so price wise it is my personal review not to go with this scooter, other emerging brands are arriving in 2022, so its never late to wait for a perfect model to get launched."
Good to go with Electric Vehicles,5 months ago by Krishna,4,"To conserve our environment, use of electric vehicles is an proactive action. Electric vehicles help reduce  vehicular pollution, noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and more. In upcoming years, India is becoming an EV superpower since many e-mobility companies such as Ather energy, ola electric, AMO electric bikes, Simple energy, Ampere vehicles, Okinawa are all ready to penetrate Indian EV space with great products."
Best EV for me,6 months ago by Bhanuprakash,5,"Best electric vehicle this is. Compared to ola and other electric vehicles this is the best I have felt. Though ola gives more range than Ather. For example Ather is like Samsung and iPhone. Others are like oppo, vivo and mi. |From my experience I drive daily for 40-50 kms per day. I don't need higher km range as I do not go touring in this. So I feel Ather will be better to buy. Its quietly simple and awesome. It's features are not too low nor too high and it is simple as I am.. Simple things always looks good and attractive."
Good but highly priced,6 months ago by Sivakumar N,2,"Took a small test drive. Experience was good. The vehicle body frame and design are good. Belt drive may be a under design. The mileage of 85 kms per charge is very low compared to what claimed by ola and simple one. Very very highly priced. (on road rs1.51/- at Chennai)  service cost of 2500/- at every 5000kms is also very high, subscription of app 2400/- per annum is also high. No free service. With very few electric scooters in market, they might survive now. In a year or two, they might not be in the market or might loose business if they don’t reduce the price and with other competitors coming in soon. For this price, it is not worth. If you have money and conscious about environment, you can buy."
My ather and experience,6 months ago by Madhavaraj,5,I am a two wheeler lover.The ather 450is fulfills my needs by being1 maintenance free.2. Excellent pickup.3. Experience a good regeneration during coasting.4. Good braking distance to achieve short control.5 stability on road.6  comfortable seating arrangement.7 good dealer support8 timeline delivery.9. Wonderful on line support form technical team.10. Last ather is price to invest.
Overpriced but worth every penny,7 months ago by Arun,5,"A tad bit overpriced but its the best EV currently in the market don't fall for the trap of ola and simple one, just test drive either way before buying. Ather is a proven commodity for past two years whereas ola and simple don't have it yet.Ather servicing and customer service is very good even in the extreme circumstances they were of help to me."
World smart electric scooter,7 months ago by Sangam Ghorpade,5,"I love this scooter, is it most powerful smart scooter than any other scooter.Suspension is very smooth.Superior Ride.Unbelievable torqueI reached a top speed of 93 km/hThe sound is like a boing 737 JET.I like this smart display with 4G connectivity...GPS systemAccuracy of range in kilometersOn display as well as mobile phone."
Perfect from every angle.,7 months ago by Samarth Patel,5,"Those who are giving Ather 450X bad rating are only rating in terms of pricing though it is somewhat costly but Ather is way to good then any other vehicle out there in market. It's speed and pick-up is awesome and as per my daily use it gives minimum 85 km of mileage per charge. So, people who are reviewing it bad must see it from every angle."
After ola and simple one Ather seems an uneth,9 months ago by Suhag,1,"After the release of ola scooter and especially simple one, I feel cheated. Even a small company like simple one is exceeding by far on every aspect (203 km range, 72 nm torque etc.). Ather has been extorting money in the name of fancy vehicle. Taking advantage of consumers because you have a monopoly is not a way to earn trust of your customers.Highly doubt Ather will ever deliver anything at the right price."
I like this scooter really super fast,10 months ago by Daniel,5,"Very nice scooter really super fast scooter. I am enjoy driving, very good features thank you Ather, I am driving 75 days no complaints, no problem with this vehicle."
Best But overpriced,10 months ago by Rahul S,5,"its a best bike for city but price is too much. The bike's real cost is around 90k to 100k  but its overpriced and the company has many plans. Its cost shows like 2.4k for a year and including service plan but they have raised the price too much,  Overall best bike but new Ola bike is arriving soon. Ola may be a best option than Ather 450x."
"Most attractive design, reliable & powerful p",10 months ago by Kotesh Bagati,5,Ride experience is too good. It has wonderful braking confidence in moped category of this segment and the best suspension as well.Color options & design of this model is very much attractive.It would be good if Ather can focus to maximize the charge points through out Hyderabad as their volumes of business grow much faster.
Best in class. Do not fall for negative revie,10 months ago by Pankaj Khairnar,4,"Don't know why people are rating this bike low. I am a using this from April 2021, my daily run is 60-62 km, everyday I take my Ather to home and office, there is no single point where I can say I paid too much for this. Honestly I am satisfied and I am feeling more younger when I sit on it and ride it. This Ather team has made a marvel."
Yamaha rx in Ather 450x,11 months ago by Boobal,5,"Hassle free buying experience with skilled technicians...Replaced my rx 135 with ather450x, liked performance same as rx with 450x. Service persons are too fantastic and best in this price range....Not tired of continues riding at 40 km/h and 85 km/h upto 50km ride.... Comfort and speed is the best part of Ather 450x."
Too costly to afford for middle class people,1 year ago by Sathyamurthy,1,Pricing is too much as you need to pay more. No proper assistance. Don't buy Ather go for TVS or Bajaj.Insurance costs you 5000 rupees.Check other electric vehicles as their pricing is less than Ather.TVS iQube is good at its price or check Bajaj Chetak.Wait for more EV's to come in years. The future is electric only.
Take decision by thinking thrice,1 year ago by Rex,1,Pros:-Comfortable in riding. No back pain and good experience while taking delivery. May be more than a 150 cc bike. Brakes are good does the workSeats is like a jelly seat it is also good.Cons:-Subscriptions for facilities I hated it. Range is not getting as described.Price is very high not easy for a middle class.
Crap pricing and only one main showroom their,1 year ago by Shubendu,1,"Previous model was around 1.2 lakh now 1.8 lakh, even we can ride petrol bike buy pay 200 per liter more .Also don't get trap for those they say about cost saving for that millage and speed we can buy good bike or scooter for less than a lakh still get a better mileage and cost effective. And monthly subscription for other features."
"Worst Experience, and high price",1 year ago by Nirmala,1,"Buying Experience: not a happy experience for anyone due to a long waiting period and because of the pricing tag. 1.89 lakh's in Bangalore is the actual price. Only one branch in Bangalore and people need to go there for any small issues.Riding Experience: pickup is the only good thing. Height is a little more and will.be tough for those with less than 5.5 feet height. Shock absorbers are worst and riding experience not good on uneven roadsConnected features need a subscription. Otherwise even an app or charging station charging does not workJust around 70 to 75 km actual distance with one charge which needs 5 hours to charge again. Looks: ok ok, different look but not so comfortable. Very few options in colors also.Servicing: only one service center in all over Bangalore, company say they will pick and drop but that need a subscription.Pros: PickupMake in IndiaCons:Price, 1.89 lakh's actual on-road price (government gives 29k discount)Government discount will go to company pocket.5 hours charging needed for 75 km travel.Only one branch in Bangalore for all service and issues.After-sales response is not very good.The charger is external and needs to be fixed to the wall.Long travel not feasible as the bike does not have an internal charger.An external charger is heavy and costs 15k extra.Proper planning of ride needed, one wrong route will screw-up our travel.Very few charging points and many do not work.The battery will discharge while biking not in use.Worst shock absorbers.Extra height.Subscription for servicing.Subscription use maps and connected features."
High cost,1 year ago by Kalaivendhan,1,"Cost is very high otherwise is good and no removable battery, need to improve the range of bike cost is very high otherwise is good and no removable battery, need to improve the range of bike."
Safety issues,1 year ago by Anand Rathi,2,"The heaviest part of the bike i.E. The battery is above the wheel hub (bearing) line thus making the centre of gravity higher. I have noticed that you cant tilt much when cornering or the vehicle will definitely lose balance. Will be tough to ride this on wet streets in monsoons. This is a major safety issue. Also, the battery doesn't look like it will last long."
Future is electric,1 year ago by Srinivas,5,"It's a beast for the price you pay. You can compare its performance to a Duke 250 on full throttle but ignoring the top speed. It goes up-to 80kmph in the city which is enough and what I liked is the build quality. Things you must keep in mind b4 buying the bike:1. You need to charge it regularly and manage it well. If you can't manage the vehicle by charging it regularly or forget often to charge, don't buy this vehicle.2. You need to understand how the ecosystem works. The hefty price is not only for the vehicle. You get other services as well. Although for 1.6L I definitely feel it's worth it. You don't have to pay for petrol. That's a huge W.3. Make sure you know the nearest charging station so that it's convenient for you to charge your vehicle fast.Don't worry they provide you with a charger at home as well.4. You need to be gentle with the brakes. The bite is too good and you need to get used it."
Pathetic Experience,1 year ago by Ram Mohanreddy,1,"Buying Experience:Buying experience is pathetic, i have pre-booked vehicle by seeing an ad with false information. Waited 11 months to receive vehicle. No proper information given at purchase time also. No proper invoice it self. Govt discount will go to company account.Just a very normal electric scooter given for an amount of 1.89 lacs moneyAll the other features need subscription and subscription amount changed multiple times before even startRiding Experience: One good thing is pickup, but shock absobers are pathetic. Need flat road to have peaceful riding.Public Charging points not available properly, and those available does not work, and it need solid 6 hours to get chargedCompany claims 15km for 10 mins charging but it never works with fast charging also (tested from ather Experience center it self)Ather mobile app is just a waste it wont show basic information also with out subscription.Maps and dashboard get stuck in the middle and make u get confused with no information on how many km left on driveKeeping idle will reduce charging, 15% went to zero in 2 days.No portable charger, we need to pay 10K more to get portable charger even after buying scooter with premium amount of 1.89 lacsOver all no satisfaction from 1.89 lacs scooter, it will be  just a show piece after few months."
Good,2 months ago by Ais,5,"Riding is excellent, quality up to mark, key is still the best way to operate a two wheeler, acceleration is epic.Ather needs to improve the rear view mirror and increase no of charging stations. Introduce cruise control through software update. Still a good option in 2022 i wish the price can be reduced by better subsidy rules."
Ride and relax!!!,2 months ago by Savitha,5,Loved this amazing swadeshi-made vehicle!!! very good performance without any problem. Storage space is quite spacious. The back footrest is very comfortable. Reverse gear is an added advantage. Charging is very easy. Looks good. Customer service is fine. Overall good performance. Definitely would like to recommend this vehicle. The only suggestion  company can think of little more mileage (km/charge)
Review,2 weeks ago by Hemant,5,I got the bike delivery within 10 days of the order. A very good experience riding the bike. Looks are very attractive performance is best in the segment and live feature is amazing with the online app of ather. The only problem is the range is only 70km after full charge but if you got a portable charger you can charge it anywhere.
This is my honest review after riding for 750,2 weeks ago by Shivaprasad S,5,"This is my honest review after riding for 7500 km and 9 months.I bought this bike in Aug 2021. The buying experience was not that great, but all that faded out in the excellent performance and quality of this bike. The riding experience was amazing. What I found was Ather has tested this bike in most Indian conditions and it is well suited for Indian roads. Looks are undoubtedly sporty, performance is superb has mentioned in numbers in the website. I had done one service after 5000 km, it cost me some 1200 rs. No maintenance charges except service.Pros.1. Excellent Performance2. Looks3. No maintenance except servicing4. Service cost is low5. Riding experience6. Useful OTA updatesCons.1. Price is comparatively high 2. Buying experience is not impressive3. Range is 90 km. Which would have been 150km for the daily commute."
It's premium e-scooter like apples iPhone,6 months ago by Sunil,5,"Just walked into the showroom Ather space , madhapur, Hyderabad...Excellent reception and test ride went so smooth and booked my 450x.  It's a premium e-scooter just like an apple's iPhone. This scooter is designed perfection to the core. Of course very few minor flaws are there just like few dashboard software glitches. But overall riding experience and comfort and quality is just unmatchable. Because before buying this tried several brand's e scooters but none of them were able to match the quality of Ather 450x. Of course it is expensive but every penny which we spent on this is 100% wrathful. Its premium so obviously the price also little premium only. You don't believe when ever i stop my scooter at signals most of the people will ask about the scooter because of its attractive looks and dashboard. Once if you test ride the vehicle i am sure you will love it. Pickup is amazing. For city commute it is the best. And Ather is offering free grid charging also which is an added advantage. Overall the best Ather 450x. So far I have finished 1000kms in 45days. Combi disc brakes are really amazing works perfect. I wont say about future but in the current market 450x is best."
Ather 450X review,10 months ago by Vinay,5,Basically bike is superb no doubt at all. The major issue of people is price TVS IQUBE VS ATHER.ATHER Price includes the charger price but for TVs iqube we have to spend another 8500 rs..no touch screen and I personally visited the showroom the way they take of the customers too worst and Ather they will give u the best customer experience. The software is Ather far better than iqube and the vehicle is far far ahead of iqube.
Never buy hero electric bike,1 year ago by Yash Naik Pednekar,1,"Worst bike and the service, it was the biggest mistake of buying this bike, since a year now the battery had a problem and no replacement, the battery is costing half of the new bike so it's totally waste. There is no service station in goa, they have to come from kolhapur and we have to pay separately for all the traveling expenses."
Worst bike. Worst battery,1 year ago by Umar Abdul Kader,1,I purchased this Hero branded before 6 years. There is problem with battery from the beginning. But dealer not serviced and in 7 months totally bike was stopped. Also dealer told purchase new battery. He is not replace or service battery and after some days dealership also closed. So be careful. It's my experience.
Worst bike never buy.,1 year ago by Santosh,1,"Horrible bike. After driving it for a year, I know in and out of this bike and its support. And my opinion is don't ever buy this junk bike. Reasons. 1. Company claims wrong figures about its mileage of 55 km/battery. My bike never gave me more then 45 km/battery. Company is fooling its customer through false claims. 2. Poor material of critical components like motor and battery. I already touched upon initial battery response. After a year, bike is giving less then 30 km on a full charge. The motor of bike has got damaged within a year. Both are covered under 3-year warranty, but support too is horrible. 3. Customer support is horrible. Even after 15 days of issue identification, company hasn't still replaced motor and battery that ere covered under a 3 year warranty. I reached out to their engineer many times a day, but no response from him. He neither picks up the calls, nor responds on what's-app. All the good will of hero motor corp is getting damaged because of this company (hero electric) and its employees. Now, if you have spare money to waste, then still there are better options that this junk piece of bike. Give it to some beggar rather than cribbing after investing in this junk bike. My final verdict. Never even think in your dreams of investing money in this bike."
Okay to buy but not wow factor,1 year ago by Kalyan,3,"Bought in Nov 2020, within 1 week suspension started making noise, dealer keep saying that there are so spares and it's been 4 months nothing got fixed. Using the same way even it makes noise. Quality of the bike is low. The only advantage is that we could avoid petrol pollution. Please buy the vehicle if dealer is giving all at once."
Very good & eco friendly scooter,1 year ago by Abhishek Mishra,5,"Everyone should own this type of e vehicles to step against global warming. Optima hx is very good handling scooter with single li ion battery. I request to everybody. Please go for e-vehicles to save our environment & planet. Optima hx provides anti theft alarm too, which I like most."
Fact & review of hero optima hx 3 month usage,1 year ago by Agniraja,3,"I bought new optima hx on December 20. 3 month usage reviews.Buying good, riding good with solo. Looks excellent. 1.They shows 80km city mileage. No actually you can get 40 to 50 km per charge only. 2. Capacity  2 member and 150 kg. ride solo get better mileage that to 50 km per charge. With two you end up with 40km only. Pick up  is poor with 2 person.3. Charging time min take 5.5 hrs. Instead of claim 4 hrs. I use stabilizer for charging. 4.  Four times charging  get stuck. I have to cut of mcb and turn on.5. The claims vehicle run 10km with 47v . Absolute not. When it reaches 47v within a km or 2 km vehicle stops. . Battery indicator show different level. Please note every one . It doesn't run more than 50km.Better charge every 40km."

Not to buy this bike.,1 year ago by Snehal Hemant Bendale,1,"Poor quality material is used, Within 2 months seat joint is broken. Small kid's toy's material is better than the material used in the bike. There is no shock up while using break. too much bad quality. There is no indication of battery level. Not to buy this bike in your dream also."
Good,1 year ago by Sudhindra K,3,Good vehicle but the range is a bit less as compared to expectations. Quality is lesser as compared to petrol counterparts however very very economical and good for short city rides not good for highway rides or long rides. For longer range pay additional and buy 2 battery version or better battery version

Need to change,1 year ago by Parmanand,1,Very bad experience from dealer . I bought photon model in 2017. Dealer do very bad servicing of vehicle . Any one or more part  found broken in every servicing . So with in 2 years my vehicle is very noisy . Battery quality is not good . It's life cycle is about 1.5 or 2 years. Battery cost is about rs. 18000 . Spending of rs 18000 in every 2 tears is too expensive.   i like battery bike but do not want to go with hero electric and dealer also.

Optima vrla. Great idea. Poor battery,1 year ago by Shuvayan Mukherjee,4,Bought it amidst lockdown. Congratulations to hero electric for venturing into the field of riding with zero emission. Really appreciate such moves. Riding experience is good. Better suited for single riding rather than double carrying.. The battery of vrla model doesn't charge fully below 12 hours. Moreover the capacity of the motor to perform at battery levels below 30% is really poor. So after a maximum of 40kms one needs to recharge it for full performance. Probably the lithium version works better.
Bad bike,1 year ago by Sibu,1,I bought from optima from st. Thomas agency thrissur on june 2018.After  1 month  the shop is shut down.This is the waste experience after only 20 month the controller is damaged and no spare part available.  No resale value. Not reliable scooter. Poor and performance is not good.This is waste product and services.
Keep away from this !!,1 year ago by Arun,1,"I purchased hero electric optima and was thrilled at owning an environment friendly zero emission electric vehicle. Unfortunately that was the only thing i could be thrilled about. In exactly 16 months, the battery died. The mechanic visited my premises and give the sad news, like we hear doctors announcing the death of their patient. But here, i was the victim. The cost of replacement was 45% of the original cost of the bike !!! not joking...Serious. Now i'm in a dilemma, should i replace this every 16 months, which is equal to buying a new bike every 2 years !!...Or simply but a decent,  ""good old"", fossil fueled scooter.  Outrageous....Keep away from this product, till they promise better batteries that last longer or cost reasonable."
Hero optima - really worthless vehicle,1 year ago by Swati Priya,1,"This is a really bad bike, it has been 15 days since i bought it and it has got problem in the battery.

Low build quality.4.Servicing and maintenance: doesn't require service like fuel vehicle.5.Pros and cons: Pros:- light in weight. Easy to handle. No service required. Environment friendly. No noise population. Large boot space.Cons:- due to light in weight when trucks or buses quickly pass away nearby the scooter flicks a little.Cannot place the scooter everywhere at hilly areas the scooter found to roll backwards.Their is a chance of decrease of range because of the rider weight, height of climb, loading weight. Etc..When it is kept in rain the scooter runs but the meters get stuck for 1 hour and becomes normal. So keep it away water but the scooter is water resistant and water proof."

If battery sustains than its a option one can,1 year ago by Shailesh,2,Battery inflated in six months of purchase same happened 2-3 new batteries. Company should do something that the battery sustains atleast 1-2 year or 10000 km or may be 500 charging cycles. The body strength is not worth spending 36000 what I paid as it is very delicate plastic body. Company do not receive phone call or also don't reply mail even. Overall hero could be mismanaged organization.

My views about optima,2 years ago by Ayush Raj,5,This electric scooty is best for college students and official works .It is available in many colours . It can get full charge in 3-4hours and can give 80km backup. I use this scooty for college . It's look is very beautiful. The dealer sold me this and told me the necessary information and i am following the instructions given by him and it's working nice by his given instructions.Its service is very low as compared to any petrol-diesel vehicles. It's only cons is that it can't be used for long distance.
Excellent but can make some changes,2 years ago by Arun,4,"Really nice to ride in it.I have it for nearly for 5 years. Electrically chargeable. Doesn't require licences to drive,doesn't require helmet but it will be safe to wear.I changed the battery twice for 2 and 1/2 years but the shop retailers suggested for only for one year.I will be a good choice to buy it.In full charge it will travel about 55km at 30km  second ."
Satisfying looks but not as good battery,2 years ago by Abhinav,3,"Buying experience was quite satisfying.

Battery service costly and Battery life is sm,2 years ago by Sandip Das,1,"Do not buy e-scooty , otherwise you will suffer . I am writing this review after using middle of 2016 . Worst battery service . Stock battery dies within 1 year and 2 months . I did not use 8 months thereafter . Then I installed new set of battery middle of 2018 and wished this time more careful about battery than before . But what a bog mistake . Now again I am suffering . New battery dies again within 1 year only . Let me clear that I am very careful about battery . I never charged it to the load of 100% . I always charged less than 100% . I never loaded my scooty to much because I was fearful about over-load damage . I always discharged it fully before charge again . And every time I gave at least 1 hour rest , before and after charging . But still it depressed me ."

Insurance must be available for low speed bik,2 years ago by Rajiv,3,"I had electric optima la battery model earlier also., again i bought optima with li battery model., riding experience is good as earlier - smooth running without any noise . Amazing style - looks pretty , but the thing which i dislike the structure made with fibre - may not resist prolong . Somehow it is better then earlier. With li battery vehicle goes hike in price - at this price tag that should be insured , company must look after in this matter for those who have purchased scooty too. I had brought yesterday evening on 13th june , hope it will be again better - hopefully some more better experience for me and kids too , as i purchased low speed scooty. Must provided with insurance facility."

Worst service i faced in my life,3 years ago by Shiladitya Chakraborty,4,"Product is good. But service is measurable. My under warranty battery taken by dealer for replacement >15 days. Still no one knows the status. Service manager, dealer customer service dept all in dark. No job sheet is there. Hence i can't even go to court.The vehicle is good. It used to provide mileage of 50. But after 10th month mileage reduced. In 11th month i approached co for battery replacement."
Review,3 years ago by Ashish,3,"Only problem which i faced with this scooty is mileage, as it runs only 30-40 km however company has claimed for 60km. If company can look into this and get it resolved, it will be super bike, people really liking this one, when i on road and they as the details of the same. Only constraint is mileage.Looks are awesome, no one can tell by looking that its a electric bike."
Review,3 years ago by Lucky,5,"This scooty is cheap in comparison to his price ,over all this is working but his engine performance is not working when scooty cross 1,00,000 km ,so over all scooty is better than activa 4g,5g,125 activa this is made by hero hero is best in mechanism of scooty and bike so i will prefer to buy optima hero."
Hero optima is best,1 year ago by Yash Gajbare,5,Buying experience was great.Looks and performance are excellent. It is very comfortable to ride. Servicing is also not costly . And hero gives us 3 years warranty for battery. And the scooter who's speed is 30 does not require license. Charging takes 4 hours to complete and once charging is done full you can ride till 60 km.
Not very good,1 month ago by John,2,"1,2,4 service center not cover warranty any minor problems. I will face many problems this optimal hs500. Very slow scooter. My headlights problems.

Hero Electric Optima review,4 months ago by Wren Roy,2,"The waiting time after making the 3000/- advance is about 2 months. The vehicle built quality is not that good and breaks are not good. The distance covered per full charge is 100 km (expected). But the operational cost is very low compared to the petrol scooters. Service side till now I have not experienced. Seat is not that comfortable. If you have some alternative, then you may not think for it. Look wise ok. Speed is max 48 km/h which i got with 2 persons riding on it. The body parts are of fiber. Subsidy amount of 43000/- will come after 3 months of registration."
Its average product,3 months ago by Prashant Singh,3,"Built quality is bad.  Body parts are made up from poor quality plastic, mudguard, motor cover panels etc but battery performance is nice. Speed is sufficient for city ride but on climb, it feels lack of power. Company should improve their mechanics, costumer care, spear parts availability network etc."
Below average scooter products,3 months ago by Rameshwar Deshmukh,1,"1)buying experience is very bad  not  fulfilled any comments,2) not comfortable. 3) average. 4) very low quality material used required heavy maintenance.5) breaking system is very poor. Drum break is always broken. Rainy & moist seasons breaks is not operate gives the noise and jam the whole scooter running it very horrible & difficult to move the vehicle even single inch also. Head light is low beam."
Hero optima li low speed,2 years ago by Celestine,3,"The buying experience was just amazing. I was hoping to buy a scooter that helps my spouse to learn riding a scooter. It is really helping my spouse. I am using it on a daily basis to commute around 30 km. This has perfectly saved my pocket from fueling my car on daily commute. The only thing i am very much concerned is the speed. I bought a low speed model thinking that it is sufficient. Trust me it is not working out on roads like the omr it express way. If i have to make a turn on a 3 lane road, i really need to be cautious as the speed is not in sync with others on the road. I would suggest not to go with a low speed model. Rather get high speed models, that may come in good for such roads."
Test ride review,2 months ago by Ritwik,4,"I took a test ride at westend mall aundh and really liked the entire experience. The bike is very easy to handle, has a sporty design and is very comfortable. I even sat with a person behind me, and there was no problem in speed or the handling of the bike. Booked one, hope they start delivering kratos and kratos r soon."
Worst every bike...,3 months ago by Bharathi Chandran,1,"While in thailand we have rented 5 honda click scooters and 7 in total. The bike i rented from aya was poorly maintained, had half a tank of fuel when I rented, and i didn't feel comfortable riding it because of all the issue it had from prior accidents from previous customers. When asked to switch bikes there were none left so we ended up having to use it. Every other bike we have rented has been amazing.As for the business side of things, the renting of the bike was ok but trying to return the bike was a hassle. The process was confusing and when we didn't have the receipt which was missed place whilst traveling, staff became very rude and unhelpful. The woman we were working with had the worst attitude when trying to exchange our bike for the passports and was generally very unpleasant to work with even for simple paperwork."
"No more waiting, go for another one",2 years ago by Bhavesh Patel,1,"Waiting for so that now i have removed this bike from my favourite list, will definitely go for other electric bikes already available in India, commitments should only be made when the company is sure about its release and availability to the consumers, this firm is still struggling for its research and development."

But some issue i thought is deciding factor like price is little bit high, and the availability & the most important point service points these are major point in my sight."
Awesome,3 years ago by Sujay,5,"Awesome electric bike and eco-friendly too low nvh n peace of mind,totally superb bike and riding experience is too good, look wise is great road presence, performance is too high, very low maintenance Only problem is lack of charging points otherwise too good electric bike In this segment this bike will be first in class."
Vfm but only needs a proper infrastructure fo,3 years ago by Nihar Patil,5,"This is one of the kickstart in the market of two-wheelers which will end a region of rising oil prices. The design of the bike is fairly based on fz-s, as it was tork motorcycle's 4th prototype. Since it is an electric bike, the fuel tank is converted into 11l boot space, large enough to fit a full sized helmet. The only issue it might face is the charging points."
Very good bike,3 years ago by Manish Yadav,5,"I like this bike, this is very grateful experience, i like electric bikes, there is no  worry for petrol  filling and waste of money.

Review,3 years ago by Tejash,3,"Total price of this bike after taxes will be 1.36lakh. Which is too much high for Indian two wheeler market.And there is no charging station available so if we ride from mumbai to vapi-gujarat then we will have to drive for 100 km then for 70 km we bike need to be send by transporters vehicles.Option to change battery need to be available so we can carry two charged batteries while travelling for long distance.And price must be below 1 lakh, if govt provide subsidy then only people will be interested in buying environment friendly vehicles."
Money saver,3 years ago by Nawalshan,5,"The price is decent for this bike, even if some users find the price a little high. The only difficulty we south Indians may face is that the showroom is up north. If we ever come across any issues , if would be hard for us to contact service centres. In all other aspects, i think this bike is gonna change everything. A huge relief would be that we don't have to pay for petrol anymore. The bike has decent power too which other electric scooters lack and of course it looks good."
A review,3 years ago by Mantripragada Sai Pavan Aditya,5,"Bike comes with an dc brushless motor with an battery capacity of 72ah , which means you can seamlessly ride upto 90-95 kilometres per full charge on a heavy traffic road and bms system gives you a auto maintenance of bike due to its cloud connectivity , the company gives suggestions about your bike maintenance if required and it comes with good storage space and charging ports."
Range is the matter of concern and price is l,3 years ago by Praneeth,4,"On a whole tork t6x will costs you around 1.36lakh including taxes and all. Which looks slightly higher price for a normal guy like me to think of buying it. But, when i see the specifications (electric, design,mobile & bike connectivity, cloud connectivity with the manufacturers,top speed,charging time,water resistant battery) , i feel it is worthy to give a chance of buying.When it comes to the range(100km) , we might not getting the 100km range while driving on different roads using different speeds as 100km range suggests 0-100 percent battery. So we can get around 70km range while riding which is slightly lesser i feel, which is why i gave 4 stars,if it is around 150km then it would be the best choice.Coming to the tubeless tyres,abs breaking technology sounds good.I don't know whether the battery is detachable or not.Because detachable battery nodes are easier to carry for charging."
Fabulous bike,3 years ago by Parvez,4,"Its an amazing bike. It has fabulous look with great pickup and speed of around 100 kmph. Control of the bike is good, speedometer is accurate and not like other e-bikes who are using fake speedometer to fool their customers. I was riding on this bike and my friend was on discover 125 cc and i was able to win the race. Top speed of discover 125 cc is 90 kmph. Its so easy to charge and we and no need to kick start it just move the accelerator and bike starts running."

Awesome bike. Only ABS is missing.,4 years ago by Sadanand Adilkar,5,Bike will set a benchmark in Indian daily commuting.Bike has all the required attributes. It is only lagging in terms of safety. The company should allow dual channel ABS at least optional for the bike. With ABS it will be a complete package. Please set up a dealership in Mumbai which indeed will be the bigger market for the bike.

Good for renew energy,3 years ago by Raghu,4,"The electric motor on the t6x is good for 27 nm of torque and claims 100 kmph of top speed from the motorcycle. Weighing just 130 kg, t6x even claims a mileage of 100 kilometers on single charge. It carries nearly every safety feature like dual disc brakes, abs, anti-theft alarm and even takes just 60 minutes to charge the battery. It rivals no other as its exclusive place makes it the best electric two wheeler of the country."
Amazingly surprise,3 years ago by More,5,Must buy bike as it have capacity to run around 100 km and with lot of weight . So for daily need it's a comfortable bike to use in city and around city .

These are important things to be note in electric scooter. Finally priced at such much special features containing scooter is first low price in top speed scooter @75kmph."
First Impressions,2 years ago by Dev,5,I've owned this scooter for almost a month now and it's turned out to be very efficient. The scooter seems to be cost efficient in the long run given the fact that its electric and could save fuel prices if used everyday. The technology and quality of mechanical parts are on power with the best in the auto sector. The features are also a huge plus with regenerative power and bluetooth sync. Overall a great scooter.
Great to drive,1 year ago by Abhay Shinde,5,"Leg space is small otherwise it's good scooter than petrol ones. I have to give information about this scooter number of people every day when i drive.

Bajaj Chetak price increase.,1 year ago by Anil Bharti,1,"Bajaj Chetak has increased the price of their electric scooter for second time without any noticeable up gradation. The first hike was Rs.5000/- and thereafter a whopping hike of Rs.27000/- in March 2021.”Bajaj” is exploiting the trust of Indian customers who are having great faith in this brand. On the contrary, the manufacturer has little sentiments for their trusted customer and encashing every opportunity to swallow the subsidy amount and hard earned money of the buyers. As a thumb rule the production cost goes down with increase in production volume. Then why so frequent and intense price hikes? this is not only the story of Bajaj Chetak, every second electric scooter that gain slightest popularity has adopted the similar strategy, like Ather-450x who did raise a few months back. They have no ethics, no sentiments for environment, country or people. I appeal to general public to boycott their products, there are many other great options available in Indian market, and we just need to give a fair trial to many other new manufacturers. Our entrepreneurs must imbibe the thinking of Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Electric Company, whose sole motive is to save environment and promote electric cars. Their technology is open for everyone."

Ola s1 pro review,6 months ago by Shivang,4,"Let's start it from its exterior. The ola s1 pro has got fabric body and the battery part is metallic finish to protect the battery. The ola s1 pro has got all led lights including indicators, headlamp, taillamp and the s1 pro has got 2 led headlamps and you can choose to light up 1 or both. Coming to the touch screen of s1 pro, the touch screen has got all information regarding the s1 pro the speed, battery, km driven, km left to drain battery and also it got a bluetooth connectivity for maps. BTW it has a offline map also for attending calls, cutting the calls. The s1 pro have 2 speakers, could you believe it. You can listen songs by bluetooth connectivity on them and the s1 pro has got a usb socket also and the utlity space on both the knee sides. Now moving on to the top speed of s1 pro. OMG, the first scooter I have ever seen which reaches 110-115 km/h easily. It has got 3 modes normal, sport, hyper.  Whenever you switch modes from normal the screen shows you the decreasing battery which is normal. The full capacity of full charge running of s1 pro is approx 180 kms which is awesome. Now let's move to the boot space, It has got very huge boot space. You can easily fit 2 helmets on it. Now moving to the looks, touchwood the ola s1 pro is very good looking and premium scooter. You get alloys and both disc brakes.. In my opinion it is the best smart electric scooter available in India with decent price.. The price of s1 pro is approx 1,20000 INR. Now move to the pros and consPros-1-looks2-performance3-heallty for nature4-resonable for running cost5-boot space6- the smart touch screen7-and more and more mileage Now let's move to the consCons-1-costly price2-mono shock suspension."
Ola s1 pro,1 month ago by Shreyasjaware,5,It is just amazing and the top speed on paper is 115 km/h but in real in turbo mode it gives a top speed of 70km/h and the charging time is not so much because when we see the range after 100% charging the vehicle it gives a range of 147 kms. The charging time is 7 to 7.30 hours.

Surely you will regret about their pathetic c,2 months ago by Lakshman,1,Please don’t buy ola. They have the most worst customer service.. There is no dedicated customer care number to contact them. Always you will end up chatting with dumb chatbot..They will not respond for any of your queries.You will be regretting for buying this your whole life..Stay away from ola.

Go for it & buy...,3 months ago by Rohan Patil,5,"Buying experience was little complicated but riding experience is too good. Lt looks sexy and unique. Till now ridden 500+ km. It goes smooth. And on hyper mode it goes like creasy. Over all fit and finish is ok, but i am not  complaining about it. Boot space is too large and fits 2 half face helmets easily. Please don't go on what they are claiming about range. I tested 5 times and it gave me 100 to 118 km. (from 100%  battery to 20% remaining) it means i can still go 10 km."

Full power pack machine and it easily cross 100 mark, the scooter I received has no gaps or scratches. Have inspected before pre delivery. now final verdictPros-looks, quality and performanceCons- no service center, no showroom and actual range of scooter is 135km /charge it is very low than company promises during launching. and the hump in foot area should be removed it is not practical during household use in which scooters like activa does."

To own electric vehicles is best bet today,6 months ago by Krishna,4,"To own electric vehicles is best bet today. India is the biggest two wheeler market in the world. Ev adoption is increasing rapidly world wide. India is also prepping to become ev super power with great products by ola electric, amo electric bikes, hero electric, Ather energy, ampere electric and more."
OLA S1 Pro review,6 months ago by Vishwa,5,Everything is fantastic. You must try the cruise. Also the modes which change the sounds with it are amazing. The cool pick up and the key less features adds up to my fascinating list. So... All I want to say is.. Do not think to buy this . Just go for it.
The enthusiast,1 month ago by Aravind,5,"Yeah, I experienced the best of riding the bike with the amazing features of a digital system without a physical key which is encrypted as a passcode which enables a customer to easier without losing the physical access,Secondly, the side lock system is good and needs some more tricky.The mileage of this bike is obvious and the riding experience is great smoother.The digital system is much amazing as expected totally everything is good the rating of this bike is 4.8 starings."
Very good but!,3 weeks ago by Murali Narayanan,4,"1. Buying experience: they really made us wait for a very long period. You are sure only when your vehicle is delivered. 2. Riding: it’s very good. It can just beat any vehicle on the road. 3. Looks and performance: amazing looks and superb performance 4. Pro: ride quality and eco friendlyB) pick up too goodC) comfortable for 2 personD) has a large boot space.E) built quality is very good.5. Con: a) the functional buttons are very difficult to operate.(horn, turn indicator etc)B) manual key lock is necessaryC) back number plate often hits the legD) side stand quality could have been better.E) horn sound is very inadequate.F) In real-life conditions it gives only 90 to 100 kms for one full charge(s1 pro)F) fast-charging stations and not available G) you cannot hold the brakes and accelerate the bike."
Worst purchase ever.,3 weeks ago by Ramanan,1,"Took six months more than the promised delivery date. Was stressful as they were giving false dates every time. The ride experience was initially good. However range was going low, a lot of vehicle malfunctions, cannot handle the pillion as the battery was getting overheated, promised features were missing, no updates. Lots of material quality issues. Pathetic customer care- literally no one responds or actions. Bought a new ntorq which serves the purpose. 1.5 lacs in the drain. Worst purchase ever."
Not a completely baked product,1 month ago by Dhruvant,1,"Buying experience is still frustrating. Riding the S1 Pro is great. Software is full of bugs. It abruptly goes into reverse mode without any input, even when the cluster shows that it is in forward mode. Power delivery is not consistent. Battery reaches high temperature pretty easily. Even the percentage shown in the cluster is not correct."
A genuine Review,1 month ago by Kishor,3,"I haven't bought this yet but was thinking. The riding review with one of my friends was little jerky while riding.The looks of this bike are very much different from other EVs its eye-catching, cool looks with multiple color options to choose from.Can't talk about the performance.Now coming to the servicing part I think the OLA is on the trails and errors stage and the base is not set yet to resolve the issues of its riders and customers but I believe that they will come up with the resolutions very soon for the issues which their customers are facing.Pros- Firstly it is an EV.Amazing looks.Cons-Launched in Dec-2021 in cold weather, yet to experience till this summer ends that how many more complaints to be seen and also should get ready for Mumbai rainy season to come.-It Will be more helpful for its riders if they keep the availability of their spare parts and prompt service.Until then I will not opt for EV but I wish all the best to OLA to do good to save the Environment."
100 waste of money!,3 weeks ago by Anuj,1,"The worst customer care and the bike is not giving 180 as mentioned it will give around 100 to 120 only.A charge is quickly dropping. It's not recommended for long rides (you can take 10 to 15 kms if emergency)You may think of saving the cost of petrol, but it will waste all your money on charging itself.."
New ola s1 pro user,1 week ago by Joseph Edwin,4,"Bought an ola during the holi window. Procedural time is understandable. Delivery was pathetic there was a dispute between the transporter and truck owner the vehicle was helped up on the truck for 3 days. The rep was rude but answered the mobile.Riding the scooter has power alright. Was disappointed there is no navigation preinstalled. The rep says there will be a software update. There is a scraping sound when above 35km/hr also there is a vibration that you can feel on the foot if you wear chappals. Called the company rep and he said to ride for 500km if still there to call customer care. Overhaul I'm concerned about the vibration it's 200km and still, both are there.Looks are great and good performance too. It's new so no idea about the servicing or maintenance.Looks great, spacious compartment, very silent, keyless, enough range for my daily requirements"
Iqube view of javed,1 year ago by Javed,5,"One of my close aides owns it I had ridden his this vehicle, a terrific scooter like TVs wego which I own since 2012, balance manageability,  terrific look, outstanding performance on road, cons range should be more, less pricing as if it's at per with wego price more buyers will take it, all subsidy TVs is absorbing, not passing to customers as they have base price despite taking fame subsidy from the government,  bad business practice, the government should look into this. This will help more buyers for TVS."
Make really EV bikes with better battery rang,1 year ago by Shiva,1,We all checked the bike's capacity to be 150 km's ( for 1 full charge). now its given only 80 who the hell wants to pay 1 lakh for just 80 km's. We don't need max speed for 70 km. Just 40 km/hr. is more than enough. For better safety. How many accidents need to happen . Worst experience if you expect me to say. Felt cheated.
Superb,1 year ago by Mujafar Sami,5,"I want to buy a electric bike in my city but there are no dealers here, so please give the dealership address in anantapur as early as possible."
TVS iQube EV scooter,1 year ago by Shivam Shukl,5,How good the TVS iQube EV scooter is a very much premature stage to claim how good it is in the field conditions. But some of the points to be looked can be discussed as follows. Battery - with it’s 2.2 kw battery it’s more than enough in city ride conditions say for everyday commute. With this power iqube offers a range of 75 km/h which is slightly better than Chinese rebadged scooters from other competitors. Motor power of 4.5 kw offers a better acceleration of 0–40kmph in 4.2 seconds which is slightly better too given the other competitors. A kerb weight of 118 kgs offer better dynamic riding conditions. With the low price tag next to Chetak as 1.15 lakhs is literally a competitive priced EV scooter in India than Ather and other vehicles. A charging time of 4–5 hours is enough for a day's ride with average city riding office to home commute. With geo-fencing and other loaded options vehicle looks cooler and slim compared to the others in market. Personally i would say the final performance and acceptability verdict is to be given by the sales numbers alone. That will really show how good the acceptance rate of the vehicle is. Thanks.
Go green go electric!,11 months ago by Vijay,5,"I have used jupiter and activa both. But this is an electric vehicle technically but when it comes to riding experience it feels the same. So my suggestion is to go for it!The best pro is savings, savings and savings!Buy one asap!!A. It's an Indian brand.B. Make clean air available for our kids and for us too!"
Bad service and maintenance,11 months ago by Shiva Kumar,2,"Hello,I purchased tvs iqube in march 2021, it has run 3000 km for 3 months and now there are many problems related to the speed, motor and several other problems. Full battery charging takes 6-7 hours, not satisfied by its performance, also still there are no proper service stations setup to solve the problems. Especially the service station at ramurthinagar, bangalore is very horrible. They don't even respond to our problems."
Tvs iqube overall experience after 1244 km us,7 months ago by Sridar Ramarao,3,"Buying experience - Chennai on road price is 115580/- but they are charging hefty amount on charger cable. Simple charger cable with industrial socket they have priced it as Rs.8260 which should be priced only Rs.2000/- to Rs.3000/-. Tvs has maintained vehicle price equal to competitor but huge margin in chargers and accessories.Ride comfort with pillion is good and it can be used only for fixed distance usage, like only commuting to office and back to home.When 100% charged vehicle pick up is good and top speed achieved under power mode 84 km/h, in eco mode top speed is only 52 kmh. But when the power is at less than 70%, eco mode top speed is 44 to 46 km/h only. As per my experience under combination eco & power mode 68% and 32% respectively, the range achieved is 71.9 km with balance 9% charge which shows distance to empty is 7km so approx. total range is 78.9 km. The above range is with regenerative option but we could not see how much regenerative power generated in %, app do not provide any dataVery poor app design and bt connectivity issue continues and reports are not generated for a selected period.Unnecessarily head light is permanently ""on"", even thought there is one drl, horn sound is worst and not good. They should provide ntorq horn which is louder and good.Charging time is huge and it takes 6 hours to charge from 9% to 100%, tvs should come out with replaceable battery at least for the  under seat battery so we can buy one spare battery and we can use it as reserve  power back up option.The app should provide the details for every trip how much power % consumed and while charging it should provide how much units consumed for every chargeServicing and maintenance experience not able to comment we have wait and watch, tvs should provide improvements as stated above once they fix the issue to all existing customers especially removable battery option."
Tvs iqube is a very disappointing vehicle and,7 months ago by Prasanna Kumar,1,"I brought iqube in march 2021 used for about 1400 kms and the motor is dead,  The vehicle was dropped at prn motors and its been 25 days now and still the replacement is not done, the display is a waste in the bike, Maps don't work, at least clock I expected and that too is not working. Totally I wasted on such a waste bike. Please don't buy ev scooters with motor in wheel its always a headache."
Don't buy as the spares take nearly months to,4 months ago by Krishna,1,"First 7k kms no issues. Later rear wheel had a bend had to wait for nearly 3 months to get the entire engine assembly replaced as only the rim cannot be removed. After that rode for 400 kms bike suddenly stopped. Called road side assistance was informed as the bike is more than 1 year they would charge 1600 rs for mere 4 kms, took my bike myself was informed the electric coil is burnt and will not be covered under warranty fought again and was informed that it would be done in warranty. Now the bike is in service center for more than 20 days."
Defective scooter,7 months ago by Mushtaq Mohamed Ghouse,2,"I bought tvs iqube on sep 14 2021 and within one week it disappointed me according to the body condition, the rear housing panel cracked. I was not aware that its a manufacturing defect and I spent my money and replaced it, but after that within 4 to 5 days i went to the dealership and complained about it and i was told as if i have done that and after too much of shouting with the service people and mailing to customer care and also to tvs motor company. Riding in the same condition, cracks got extended till the front panel is also damaged.I got a return mail saying that our representative will be contacting you and i got a phone call from the dealership and was asked to come on 18 oct 2021. I went on that day and left my scooter for fixing and until today its with them and there is no clarity of what is happening, if i call they are saying will call me and update and its almost 1 week now and I don't have my own scooter to move around. Still awaiting for the response."
Could have been a serious top flight ev but .,6 months ago by Vishwas,3,"The tvs iqube is supposed to be a game changer for tvs in its ev debut but sadly it is let down by step motherly treatment by tvs itself. Buying was problematic as tvs as chosen only 4-5 showrooms in all of bangalore to sell iqube. For some reason, showrooms are not enthusiastic about giving test ride, following up, picking calls etc. All the push needs to come from the customer side till they get vehicle delivery. Looks like tvs itself in not eager about selling iqube in big numbers.The iqube rides very well in city conditions and like a very conventional scooter minus the petrol engine noise and vibrations. No complaints there. No hassles with pillion rider either.Build quality is not great ..Plastic feel throughout and not the nice kind as well. Gaps between panels are clearly visible. The key fob is a prime example of giving flashiness the upper hand over quality. Mine simply split into two after a few days.Charging time takes 6-7 hours for 10% to 100% and gives upto 75km riding distance. Good for short distance rides. Charger price is extra, which is plain dumb considering every ev should have a charger in its package. The most cheapest electronic product ships with a charger and tvs chose not to. Clearly the accessory pays more gimmick. Also charging point needs a good earthing presence else vehicle cannot be charged. You will not find this mentioned in showroom.Vehicle maintenance is not much, just keep tires inflated and use water to clean and that's all it takes.But the onus is on the owner to keep the vehicle problem-free because iqube service centers are very few and you cannot get it repaired in local garages. You are at the mercy of the tvs service center which can repair it. Tvs having so much local presence already should have at least ensured that iqube can be repaired at any service center. Again this feels deliberate. My nearest service center for iqube is nearly 15 km away but there are more than 8 tvs service centers on the way which do not deal with iqube. Also spares are not compatible with any of their other products.Another thing is that tvs itself seems perplexed with many of the random things that the scooter does. My vehicle shows up with a ""close throttle warning"" at starting and tvs has not been able to tell why that comes and what the solution is. The only so called solution is to twist the throttle and leave it and hope the warning goes away. Clearly the sensor calibration is what the issue is but they want customer to change the way they drive to solve their problem. I have heard another user say sometimes the battery indicator shows 0% even if there is enough charge and need to restart the vehicle.Pros:- decent ev for someone whose daily travel is 50km and has charging facilities at home.- very good motor. Zippy, zero noise, responsive.- great handling and suspension and good ground clearance.- not complicated to use at all even with lots of electronic features.- easy to maintain.Cons:- reliability - range anxiety of ev aside, you never know which sensor might get knocked off on the iqube and the vehicle gets bricked (keep towing services number handy). Tvs should do more customer interaction to know the regular problems faced by users and only then they can solve.- serviceability is poor. Customer service almost has no knowledge of the scooter working and their only response is to ask the service center to call you. - takes way to long to charge.- there is no concept of software upgrade. Awful app.There is a lot of work for tvs to do with iqube if it wants to be considered a serious ev player. Otherwise, this model will just be a footnote in the ev revolution."
Warranty of the iqube will lose for any delay,1 month ago by Bijoy,1,"Don't buy this vehicle unless you have a near by tvs iqube service center. You will not get service in any other tvs service centers and there is not many service centers over the country. And you will lose your warranty benefits for any delay in servicing the vehicle. Once you braked the vehicle in a traffic signal, there is delay in releasing the break and moving the bike."
Part issue & not available services centre,1 month ago by Akshay Kumar,1,If any issues come in scooty parts not available at service centre & waiting time of part approximately 2 to 3 month come. I had bought this scooty & I show the service centre many of scooty come many problems & machine says the part is not available right now at service centre & part not provide tvs company waiting time from the company side of parts 2-3 month.
Middle to Bajaj who took advantage of petrol,9 months ago by Muniswamy,5,Good EV with more features. I hate Bajaj Chetak and Ather. Now the new competition has started on range and price. Super segment EV. I want the state government to give more subsidy and encourage ev brands. Waiting for this ola ev to launch in bangalore
Ola a new acronym for the word fraud,2 weeks ago by Arjun T,1,"Buying experience.I booked the scooter for September 2021. The initial promise was that the scooter will be delivered by December. Well, that never happened. Then ola changed the date to Jan. I paid the full amount in Jan and waited for the scooter.  My scooter delivery was supposed to happen before 31st Jan as per the confirmation (this is after multiple changes on the delivery date). Nevertheless, in Feb also nothing gets changed either on the app or in real-time. I did not get any calls or messages from the team.Month : march:Nothing changes. No scooter, no delivery, no calls. I tried canceling my scooter. But ola denied cancellation stating the invoice was generated.Month: April :Here I am, nothing changes. No delivery, no calls. No cancellation is possible. Ola cheated on my money.Month may:Again, the same response from ola. ""we are prioritizing your case"".  My insurance is already active (losing money there). My finance EMI already started (losing money there too). And all they say is we will get back to you. My suggestion to all those good people who get brainwashed by ola through fake advertisements, "" please please please don't buy this"". You really don't want to go through the frustration that I am going through."
OLA S1 review,1 month ago by Ashish Kumar,4,"Best bike for indian customer for this segment. Very comfortable and tubeless tyre are best performance. Boot space is very good, it is a best value for money product in this segment."
Just flashy,2 months ago by Anand,1,"Booked it and waited for 7 months. Still no update. Came to see the user review here and saw 4.5 stars. After reading the reviews i came to know that none of them had even never seen the scooter in person. This rating method is funny. Even myself who didn't own it can submit a review, that's funny.I just cancelled for the reason, it has a huge hump in the floor. The main reason we buy a scooter is, it can accommodate things in the floor, but you can't do it in ola, because things will not sit properly in the floor because of the hump.Even the storage area can accommodate only half sized helmets as proved by some youtube channels."
Avoid it.,4 months ago by Norton Peter,2,Buying has been a hassle. Placed order and am still waiting for news of the company delivering the bike.No test ride. No first look. Overall looks like a mega scam. The videos that are circulating on youtube also are not something that gives confidence in the product. The advertisement was really flashy. That's all.. Everything else seems to be a scam. Better go for Ather Bajaj or TVS. They promise and deliver.
India's future,5 months ago by Prince Domadiya,5,Ola s1 is the one of the most awaited scooter in India. I hope it will launch soon. Not so expensive as price and good looking. It has a very good mileage per charge. It's around 124 km per single charge. It's a future bike. It is the best scooter for the students. And it's not heavy compare to other bikes & scooters. Then i would like to go with ola s1.
Value for money -  eco friendly high performa,6 months ago by N Jayaprakash,5,"I booked my ola s! and paid advance of 20k, waiting for test ride in a nearby city or at pollachi. I am impressed with specifications compare to other electric scooters.  If i am correct initially ola claimed that batteries  are removable, now understand it cannot be.  Initially had some issues with the website but their customer support used to give call immediately and clarify doubts. Riding experience can be shared on having a test ride. Looks and performance looks to be good . Service and maintenance yet to be experienced. Pros - good rage for daily commuters, we support for a green world, good response from customer support.  Cons: ola has not updated the test centers, delivery slot given to me is 1st to 31st dec,21. Have doubt by looking at the way it moves.  No manual key is provided, all controls with smart phone. If I miss my smart phone what s the alternate.  If other than me if my family members want to ride they should have app in their phone . Elderly person who has no knowledge on smart phone cannot use the vehicle. Some best solution to be suggested by ola"
Switch to electric for greener tomorrow,6 months ago by Krishna,4,"Electric is the future, join hands with automakers electrifying India. Go green with homegrown brands such as ola electric, hero electric, amo electric bikes and more. No noise, smooth riding, light weight, suitable for everyone, students, elderly people and for women too. Big benefit of electric bikes and scooters is these are a high range two-wheeler you can save a lot in a year compared to petrol bikes."
A true gadget vehicle,7 months ago by Anurag Sharma,5,"It's an awesome experience driving this powerful electric machine from ola. It has great looks, pricing, features, speed nd modes. Also a lot of technology with inbuilt speakers to party anytime while hanging out with friends. In terms of service and maintenance it is very cheap and effective which will give a lot of savings to your pocket. Overall a great deal and efficient machine. No cons from my point of view."
This is truly a amazing bike,7 months ago by Rizul,4,"I really wish to have this ev scooter. The features it has are amazing and really ant to see how this stands out on road especially with its running cost.The color variants are also cool, the bike design is also classic this making it a elite bike in the ev segment and ola has done a great job.Just hope to have this bike soon in agra and can't wait to ride it."
Poor website,8 months ago by Durga Prasad B,5,"All good on paper once come to our hand, then only will come to know what is good, what is not good..

Hope so will be delivered as early as possible"
Promising n powerful,8 months ago by Hardik Bhatt,4,Recently booked s1 pro midnight blue for daily commute of avg. 22 kms. Already had activa 2005 model - still rough n tough. Second one is activa 125 - super smooth ride. Awaiting for Chetak ev but till the date not available in gujarat. Looks wise still prefer Chetak for its old charm classy look. But now ola has change the entire game by future rich technology they provide with these two newer version of scooter. In metro city there might be a bit problem of charging because of high rise and flat system but hyper charge stations comes first to them only. S1 pro promises the riding range of about 180 km on paper. As average daily commute of 22 kms for full 7 days considering we may require only max once in a week or more charging. So no problem of inconvenience.Battery life is definitely extended in above mentioned scenario. Company claims 6-7 years of battery life so no issues at all. Many features comes very first time in two wheeler segment which definitely appealing youth. Myself is convinced by the software part of the scooter. Let's hope the best about hardware part. Because the company itself has a prominent in software space not in hardware. Let's give atleast a try once.
Killer,9 months ago by Prabodh,5,"Excellent, will take away market from Ather , Bajaj who were doing well in sales ,Ola has nailed with features, range ,speed and yes!! Price. Rides smooth, stiff suspension,  excellent range ,range can be manipulated speed . Service should be good in future to compete with others who are stable in this region."
Read my review before buying.,8 months ago by Dipesh Save,2,"Company has NOT revealed the warranty period of the bike or the battery.Company has NOT revealed when will hyper charge stations come up and where.Company has not revealed the cost of Hyper charging.OLA plans to start delivery from Oct 2021 directly to user without a dealer, but has no network of Resident Engineers in 1000 cities they have taken booking from.Cost of battery replacement will be Rs. fifty thousand OLA S1 and sixty thousand for OLA S1pro.Fixed battery. Problem for residents of high rise building dwellers."
Friend,9 months ago by Radhakrishan N,5,This is to inform that this bike ola sl is excellent. All public is liking to begin with so many colorful bikes which are available but main problem is the EMI of interest rate which is highest. EMI systems are making interest rate reduced to more than 7 percent .
Save nature enjoy ride with ola s1,9 months ago by Sarin,5,This scooter looks very good. I like the parts design and it  gives good range in one charge. Whenever I buy the scooter I will choose this scooter only. Best option is to shift  to electric vehicles. I also think that our future vehicles are electric. It also helps decrease pollution. It is also good for our nature. In my opinion there is only one con in our country which is very low electric stations. That is only cons. I think.
Ola is best,9 months ago by Priyansh Adwani,4,I have not ridden this vehicle but all features which I see in the video are all best but its design should be improved more. It looks like classic scooty.
Ola Scooter,9 months ago by Dinesh Talreja,4,"It was very early to comment on it, but for now if we look on paper ola will give tough competition to Bajaj, and Ather. Ola have to give great service to customers to survive in this market so that customer can rely on their products, speed & range is good on paper but exactly will figure when we get it ."

Ola - a cheating company,1 month ago by Sanjeyk Kumar P,1,"I have experienced a worst services provided by the ola Coimbatore region. They were cheating the customers by giving false beliefs. When i know that i have been cheated by the company they convinced me and ask me to put a mail, still now no reply has been received. And also the product that ola s1 pro has been delivered to me. The become worse within the 10 days from the date of delivery which is driven less than 560 kms. They said road assistance will be provided at once you needed . But i got the road assistance more than after 16 hrs. from time that made a complaint. The cheating company ola better shutdown their business instead of giving false belief and worst product to the people.."
Unreliable ola ev scooter,1 month ago by Sameer Punjabi,1,"Worst experience after buying these ola s1 pro ev scooters. Twice my ola scooter stopped suddenly on road after a message I got on the scooter screen that the battery drained. And this even when the scooter screen was showing battery life remaining for 50 kms.As the battery is not detachable, you will be troubled and have to tow away this scooter due to unreliable manufacturing defects and the worst ola scooter support service as they never reply to your complaints.Think many times before purchasing these scooters as worst customer support and unreliable battery life."
Ola the worst electric scooter,1 month ago by Narayanankutty,1,"Ola should call the ola should call back the entire supplies.  Ola is pushing products without addressing the issues.  I booked the scooter way back in August 2021, and the delivery was made in Feb. 2022.  The total amount paid is 142000+.  The bills are available for approx rs.120000/-.    No proper response for the difference.  The initial offer of 181kms per charge is revised to 135/-kms after delivery.  The actual mileage is less than 100kms.  Never depend on the mileage shown in the display.  One day,  depending on the displayed mileage of 32kms, I took the vehicle.  It stopped on the road with zero charges.  You don't expect any service or response from ola.  The vehicle is consuming more than 10% charge overnight and such consumption will not be deducted from the display of mileage.  If the vehicle is fully charged and not used for a few days, it will continue to show full charge mileage of 135kms whereas it would have consumed more than 10%per days and the actual available mileage is maybe 40 kms.  There is no map as promised.  There is no music system as promised  the company is interested in pushing the sales ignoring the glitchesNever ever go for ola scooter at this stage.  Wait for one year and with peer-level products."
Beware and don't go for ola ev scooters,3 weeks ago by Sameer Punjabi,1,"Bad experienceBad experience I had with my ola s1 pro. The battery gets drained, even though showing a 50 km range balance on the scooter panel. Due to the battery not being detachable, I have faced lots of inconveniences as had to tow this scooter.Ola customers get a salary even if they are only sleeping and never reply to customers' grievances and complaints.Ola should stop manufacturing these scooters as it is not their cup of tea. Only harassing customers by selling their faulty scooters."
Full faulty unreliable ola scooters,2 weeks ago by Sameer Punjabi,1,Ola should better manufacture bicycles. Making EV scooter is not of their capability. company people only looting customers' money. Don’t even think of going for them. Ola scooters are worst than bicycles. And their customer support people are worst than clerks.
Do not buy!!!,1 week ago by Olavictim,1,"Do not buy!!! remember it's your hard-earned money, go for ather.No testing was done, roadside assistance is junk, impossible reliability. This company created a toy that is lethal so don't play around.It should have had a better quality battery. The reverse is not needed if not tested disable it.Remove annoying loudspeakers, no one will use ola as speakers."
Ola s1 false promise & draining fast batterie,1 week ago by Senthil Kumar,1,"Buying experience: the wait time was over and above the schedule and finally they made me visit their delivery point rather than delivering at the doorstepQuality: post 300 km my vehicle stopped abruptly in the middle of the road while it was showing 35 km to cover and battery % came down to 0. Service/maintenance: I have to push my vehicle to my home and raised a service request, ola took close to 5 days to tow my vehicle after I made several calls to their call center, on the service front. I have not got any update even after 10 days, I am following up with the ola call center daily and end up getting all false promises from the agents, I still haven't received my vehicle...It's really frustrating. I don't recommend this product as it is not mature enough to handle a better consumer experience."
Ola electric to cheat customers,1 week ago by Haribabu,1,"They cheated customers by creating hype. It stops surely but no one attends for service. Please don’t buy.Customer service, they never lift. Don’t expect a service person will visit.They don’t respond to emails too.After 10 days, I tried roadside assistance, and it worked.My scooter is ola s1 pro. Still, they have sent back scooters but they ask only to use 50% of the battery. How a joke it is.I have had Nexon ev since more than a year. Never got into any trouble. But my decision is wrong with ola scooter.In my opinion, it’s not a reliable company, it’s to cheat on either customers or investors."
My experience,1 year ago by Sriman,4,"Now a days it's very useful for daily usage. It have good pickup power. It have 51 km/h speed. I travel daily 60-70 km. It saves 100-150rupees per day. But body quality is not well, If they can improve body quality, it is the best scooter."
Review after using 4000 km in 2 months,2 years ago by Sumit Kumar,5,"When i go for inquiry in hero electric ,i liked this scooter in first look. Sales person was also good but not have too much knowledge,even he was little bit confused for some technical parts. Amazing classic look noise free very good .Speed is also good for city commuter. Best in segment.Since this is an electric scooter so its maintenance cost is very low and can say negligible. If you are a daily commuter of distance less than 50 km then this is best because it will cost one time equivalent to petrol scooter but start saving money from first day as after buying it we don't have to pay any more for petrol or service."
Still needed some changes in this model,2 years ago by Shashikant R Choudhari,4,"Every one attract towards bike looking at green number plate i.E. Eco-friendly model no fuel no voice but still needed some changes in this model, to change over button in front panel of the bike needed; both batteries is to be separated fiber to avoid collision. Head light is required much more powerful light flow."

Silent helicopter on the road,1 year ago by Huliraja G H,3,Brought last week. Dealer is very cordial bike appearance  super.  Riding super. Mileage as assured. Super sackings value for the money   in highways i felt as if going in pushpak.  I found following disadvantages. 1. Front luggage box edges very sharp and their finishing finishing worst. Hands get injured while underwriting and removing. 2.The side step for pillion rider is not researched and scientific.  3.Braking should be more effective. 4.The seat decider is unscientific ridge discomfort for pillion rider. 5.The red switch for low and high speed has reverse connected in all vehicles.
Projects as zero maintenance... But will neve,1 year ago by Ashok,1,Problems with hero electric photon bike are:1. 6 lead acid batteries make it heavier2. Bike bumper gets hit hart when crossing speed breakers and uneven roads 3. Lead acid batteries does not last long4. Batteries needs rotation every 3 months..... Hero service center never rotate batteries5. No support from show room or service. Center6. Battery drains if head light turned on7. Battery drains if drive mode is set to l (low mileage high speed)8.High cost of battery replacement makes it expensive9. No customer support.
"Good scooter, bad battery",1 year ago by P G Ganesan,2,I have bought hero electric photo IP model in September 2019. I have just completed nearly 4000 km's the battery has gone down and the shop which sold me has taken the battery for replacement the battery is trontek lithium make. The show room man is telling it will take 45 days to replace. Hero eclectic should take this issue seriously and replace the battery with some good make. There is no good review on trontek lithium batteries.
Super hero electric scooter,2 years ago by Sachidananda,5,"Great look, economic price, i ride my friend hero electric,i too want to buy.Once i ride this i wish to own it, as i am a teacher it is very useful to go to school , to go to market with double seat also. Really appreciate it as it is useful to our environment friendly, easily rechargeable with good speed."
Service and maintenance is very expansive.,1 year ago by Venkat,2,"Service and maintenance- even a small fix for breaks can only be fixed by hero electric showroom. Because parts are not available in open market, other mechanics are scared to touch these vehicles. And showrooms charge too much of price for even a small fix. Mechanics at Vijayawada service center are very rude as we are completely depended on them for fixing it."
Best electric vehicle,1 year ago by Shashank Pathak,5,"I bought this scooter in November 20 in Jabalpur (MP). My daily commute is around 30-35 kms. With the speed and pickup, there is no compromise when compared to other petrol heads.The top speed is 55 km/h, and battery lasts for around 85 kms.This vehicle is very light to ride, weighing just 87 kg.Suspension and balancing of the vehicle is good. Just as other scooters.Charging of the vehicle takes 4 hours for a full charge and around 1.5 units (around Rs.12)Looks of the vehicle is just awesome, this is an eye turner for everyone. Everyday 3 to 5 strangers asks about the performance, pricing and praise the vehicle.Servicing and maintenance is more or less nil.3 years warranty on battery and motor."
Good wife for hero,9 months ago by Shivakumar R,3,"Having owned a new type of automobile gives a thrill but all got drained when i was riding amidst a busy traffic.It is so silent; it does have initial grunt or a kind of adrenaline induced jerk that all make proud. The handling is quite nimble but the ride quality is bumpy due to its skinny tyres.Certainly after making a trip to market or so, it feels happy that i didn't spent lavishly in a petrol bunk. In contrast, as there is no indicator for warning us how much distance that it can commute, it gives a little fear that whether would it make it pull manually to home back.Two things need to be addressed soon. The in-between acceleration must be increased, otherwise, it will definitely let you on the middle of the road.Next one is the need of a meter to intimate us how much kilometers it has remaining to bring us back to home. As of now no greater cribs. Kudos to hero!"
Forget about petrol rates and ride like uniqu,8 months ago by Neeraj,5,"For me its best for for riding smooth. No petrol, free of cost and pollution free ..I personally use it daily for going to market and little bit and sometimes also went to city for long run with my scooty.. Great performance till now and i always enjoyed it while driving it."
Photon review.,7 months ago by Veer,1,"I bought this vehicle and found that the open charging port, where we connect the charger is showing 80 volts voltage always and it is very dangerous safety point.Build quality is also very poor, poor plastic used. Very poor quality seat and hinge is also very cheap. Front wheel brakes got struck from first day due to soft spring, again a poor manufactured part.Only one thing which is ok, is the looks of the vehicle.Do not buy this vehicle, wait for some good brands, to enter in this arena."
Electric is the future,6 months ago by Krishna,4,"Electric bikes and scooters are the future of mobility. Skyrocketing fuel prices are forcing people to consider more practical alternatives such as electric bikes and cars. With a great range of electric bikes and electric scooters in India by popular automakers like hero electric, Bajaj auto, tvs motors and amo electric bikes and more homegrown brands indicates it's a good time to switch to electric for a greener environment."
One of the worst scooter,6 months ago by Georgekutty,1,"I have bought photon. This was one of the worst electric scooter I have used .The turning radius of scooter is too much and if you are on highway, you need to go to other side while turning. It's front head light is too big and light is too low. You cannot see potholes or any object from the distance. It is a risky ride and quality is low."
No tension,3 years ago by Saroj,5,"Its really a tough bike to move in streets like villages and small towns. Quality of these bikes are awesome, feels difference about your daily expense. U can use this bike for your office, for buying of vegetables also for a ride with your son or wife to enjoy the outside environment. No need of tensions to fill the fuel just charge and run."

Awesome  scooter,4 years ago by Narayan,5,
Bad battery results,4 years ago by Rajendra Sabale,1,
Men don't purchase this scooter,3 months ago by Gilbert Mathew,3,"Buying experience:- within 20 days, vehicle got registered and delivered Riding experience:- turning radius is too much, which creates problem during turning. This bike is not suited for roads, which is having potholes. Shock absorber performance is not that good, due to which, back pain will affect rider. Even if company promises top speed of 45km/h, but this is without a rider. With a rider weighing 70kg, speed goes down to 40km or below.Looks and performance:- look is not that good, because, battery can be seen from rear tyre side. Seat height of vehicle is less than that of activa. Since maximum speed scooter can deliver is only 45km/h, so one can't overtake which moves at 40km speed. Servicing:- actually no major service is required for the vehicle, even though, to pay some amount to the dealer, paid service intervals added in periodic services.Pros and cons:- Pros:- powerful electric scooter at lower price. This electric scooter good for ladies. Suitable for travel on flat good roads Cons:- not suitable for tall men. Even not suitable for men, who require some speed and want to overtake a vehicle. Will feel back pain during long rides. Turning radius is more. Some times at full accelerator throttle, scooter moves half of its half maximum speed. We need to decrease the throttle and the increase it, then only it achieves maximum speed."
My bike riding experience,4 years ago by Bablu Kumar Suman,5,Awesome riding experience i feel very proud and also economically efficient.

This is the good quality of this model. I heartily recommend to every Indian to purchase this one.
Electric ride,3 years ago by Avinash Vimal,4,"The price according to petrol segment is high, but its cheaper than daily money we spend on petrol. Its very comfortable in riding. It's very smooth,and no noisy. The look are amazing, with round headlight. Front disc brake, comfortable seat, and a mobile charging port. The service is very cheap around 150. Pros are it's less noisy and cons are it's low ground clearance."
Under 50000,3 years ago by Mayur,5,Yes i have searched a lot for this bike find best under 50000 and i also find it very efficient only exception review is bad and i also want a top speed of 45 but as i ride on 55 with no problem so the very good thing is very much efficient bike i got under 50000 so my advice u can an  Indian e bike at very low price.
bike is not fit for Indian roads,3 years ago by Arjun,2,"I am using photon 72v from past 6 months.I was initial happy with the performance but, sad part is this bike is not fit for Indian roads, 1. Sudden brake and brake shoe broke 2. Speedometer not working 3. One very small impact in a pothole mudguard is broken 4. Battery went to deep discharge after 10 days of non-use. I am utterly disappointed with quality of this bike."
Don't buy hero electric bikes,3 years ago by Divakar,1,Hi i have purchased hero electric photon 72 v i enjoyed the ride up to 7 months after that it may not travel at-least 20 km i taken for service but they not replace the battery till now and my bike in service centre from three months and no proper response from dealer and company so guys my request don't buy hero electric bikes.
Its a good bike but not the best one...You wo,3 years ago by Arvinth,2,"Review will be quite bigger but its worth it, i hope,I strongly believed in hero electric , but bit disappointed on the vehicle i got, due to some problems in it. But will keep updating whether it got rectified or not & also the bikes performance in diff timelines in upcoming months.I bought this bike, hero electric photon (li model) on 10/11/2018 in erode dealership, but they delivered from another dealer due to stock unavailability. In hero electric showrooms i visited, all the staffs are decent and speaks/behaves well with customer. But they lack deep knowledge about the bikes they sell. Lesser than what i got to know while researching on choosing a good e-scooter. Also, most of the dealers don’t have vehicles for test drive(especially photon not for display also, they don’t have stock itself). This is a bigger disadvantage for both company and customers.  I went to 4 dealers in 3 different cities chennai (2 dealers), erode, trichy but they don’t have stock of photon li/photon itself.I preferred photon li model for its detachable lithium ion batteries. But its too difficult to remove batteries from vehicle. The seat plastic, covers the battery power pin/socket, so its difficult to remove the pin and lift battery. It is a major shock for me, if there was a test drive vehicle or display vehicle i would have got to know about it earlier and would have opted for some other vehicle. But i saw the vehicle for first time on delivery day only. If you are staying in apartment/ place without proper electric connection boxes in parking, then don’t opt this bike (till there is an updated version where they rectify this) as it is so difficult to remove batteries and charging it inside your home. You have to charge it with vehicle only.Then, the bike i took have following problems which disappointed me hugely. I believed in hero electric. It might be basic or small issues but facing it on first day, that too when u r travelling from dealership to home on first ride. Its so bad. Problem 1: dealership to my home is 60 kms(nearby districts). In middle of journey first battery got over and we switched to second one using the switch given under seat for changing battery from 1 to 2. After which bike didn’t started, for nearly 15 mins we struggled in middle of road and it started off by itself. Same problem occurred on day 3 also while switching from 1st battery to 2nd. Again struggled in middle of road for 20 mins Problem 2: suddenly sometimes motor is not working on acceleration. Everything else is working, from horn, headlight, indicators all are working. But if i accelerate, there is no power to motor, vehicle is not moving. I checked brake also, its not locked and brake light is off only. It happened 7 times in 3 days. In middle of road, in traffic, near home in different circumstances.Problem 3: i observe sound is coming while i stop accelerating or if i brake, its not from motor and not due to friction in tyres. But from front disc i hope. Its odd, in an electric vehicle on my first ride, a strange uncomfortable sound.Apart from these, a connector is not mounted, battery level indicator is not accurate, battery charged fully then also adapter showing red light, i have to unplug and plug again to check whether its full or not. Upon unplugging and plugging back its turning to green if charged. Adapter also have problem i hope. Remote alarm/lock ll serve only as anti-theft alarm, don’t expect more in it. Storage space below seat  is bit less compared to petrol scooters, due to batteries occupying the space. Quality, look & mechanism of the plastic separator that separates battery and storage space under seat is not good. Quality of plastics used have to be improved a bit.Pros: 1)	bike’s  look is good. Its simple and decent.2)	its really comfortable to ride, seats are spacious, foot space is good, easy to handle, less weight. Riding comfort is good, can be compared with top selling petrol bikes.3)	head light is good enough.4)	indicator can be turned off by a centre switch in indicator button which made t easier.5)	smooth ride, no noise/vibration ( exception :my defective vehicle)6)	speed and pick up is good compared to other evs. Can zip through city traffic easily. Achieves 50 kmph in flat or downside roads. 40 to 45 while climbing up (like flyovers). If compared to petrol counterparts, its bit downside in terms of pickup and speed. But more than enough for town or city commutes. 7)	with two riders also its performance is good.(though there will be slight change,only slight). It can go up to 40 to 45 kmph with two riders in flat roads & 30-35 kmph with two riders while climbing up (like flyovers)8)      braking is good, as supply will cut off once u apply brake. So braking quick and good. finally, keeping the problems in my bikes aside (hoping that these problems occurred only in my bike) , its a good choice as of now for city , town or less distance commutes. One main thing hero electric need to update in this model is making its battery removal easier. But we have to check the vehicle thoroughly before taking delivery to avoid facing problems as mine. So that you wont regret your decision on buying it, as everything else is fine/manageable except battery removal. coming to my bike: i don't know how such a faulty vehicle(which i got) was allowed till delivery. Do they  (hero electric) have any quality checks or preventive measures for such cases. Expecting a mechanic in a day from dealership as promised by them. Ll update after they service the vehicle."

Up to the mark,3 years ago by Humaira,4,My husband gifted me this bike . When i started the use of this bike for my job that time i realised that how beautifully it works. But it should be more stylish like petrol bike. If we talk about its pros and cons that bike is very comfortable in riding but only it should be little more better in mileage.

Freaking love this scooty,2 years ago by Vishal,5,"Firstly i don't know why other websites had such bad reviews mayb cuz of the previous model(cuz i have ridden and it's so so) but i am in love with this model 1) buying experience was pretty nice ..They were polite and wer patient enough to listen to our queries and answer it 2) i had ridden once  250w motor flash and it was decently nice but because of top speed being 25km its ok for short distance in dense traffic ..But this 500w motor is perfect for daily commute ..Did not expect that initial torque and power to b so much in a 500w motor..Good enough to overtake autos and 100cc bike in low speeds below 35kmphr when they are not throttling in traffic while you are its like a breeze ...No vibrations no noise and especially if u r riding in a quiet locality its like waow the only noise you here is the suspension squeaking ..I guess hero needs to improve on that( being sarcastic) hahaha ...Looks pretty decent ..And decent ground clearance...Suspension is a bit stiff but its ok for a low speed ride ... Ridden 45km and still has two bar battery , guess it will go upto 55km for sure Don't know about maintenance since its less than 30 days but i think this is a killer scooty at the cost 58.5k on-road in kolkata with 3 years warranty for all the main components ..And running cost being cut down to 70 paise/km including battery cost ..And pollution free..Just a go commute."
Best bike a money can buy,3 years ago by Vikas Garg,5,"Excellent service provided by the dealer. Riding is like surfing on the wind, i suggest it's name would be windrider as all you can hear the sound of wind on lonely road.Looks. I often stopped by people asking, what is this kind of vehicle. Never seen such a great thing.Great value for money.Must for every home."
Review,3 years ago by Anuj Jha,5,Its a amazing electric scooter.I used it for daily rough use. My daily use is approx 70 km and i m happy with it. No any maintenance till yet. And i don't think it will need any maintenance if you take care of it properly. I used to charge drive and again charge and drive some time i used to trave it in city for 80 km a day.
Perfect for city rides. Perfect on pocket !,3 years ago by B Pal,5,"Got it for 45000 on road in bangalore. Actual price is around 53000. Very smooth and 3 years warranty for all battery, motor, and controller ensures peace of mind. Very light and easy to handle. Motor cuts off during braking, which is a very good feature. Very cute looking scooter. Speed saturates around 38 to 40 km/hr. Keeping a good tyre pressure will ensure good battery life and pickup. Only one disadvantage is, can't take for a long drive, but then who takes the scooter for a long drive? the range of 60 km per charge is pretty good enough. Finally, hero has made a perfect product or the indian market."
Eco green scooter,3 years ago by Venkatesan,5,I'm want to buy this sexy slim scooter. Now a days petrol is big problem for everyone. Petrol also very bad quality and less quantity for the amount we are given. Maximum all are traveling around 50-70 kms. Per day. So i choose to buy the scooter. We are allocate around 4000-5000 rupees every month for petrol. That amount will be saved in your pocket. And our atmosphere also not polluted. The main thing is we live little bit healthy...

Altogether is waste of money on buying this v,2 years ago by Viswanathan,1,"Worst experience very difficult while driving in the bridge appearance  looks good, performance very poor service is very poor quality of vehicle is not good shock absorber  failed in two months,  if vehicle get puncture it will be headache no local shop will do puncture work and dismantling the wheel the assembling wheel is not easy connectors for the motor not accessible easily. It run for only 5000 km battery cost is high comparatively higher than petrol vehicle and only your happiness will go away by purchasing this vehicle. Lot of disadvantage is only for this vehicle.  Poor service center nobody cares for it."

Servicing very bad,8 months ago by Jithin,3,"Servicing and maintenance:- very bad attitude from dealers(Trissur). They are only for sales, no need to her any complaints from customer. Now a days not picking calls. Servicing and maintenance:- very bad attitude from dealers(Trissur, mannuthi)  They are only for sales, no need to her any complaints from customer. Now a days not picking calls."
Review,1 year ago by Srajudheen,1,The customer service is really pathetic. There is no escalation contact. No proper channel to raise complaint. I booked this vehicle and they delivered a defective meter. The showroom says they are not responsible to defect and kerala sales manager is responsible. He never picks calls. Even after 3 months defective meter is not fixed. Please never buy from hero. Very bad experience.
Poor service,10 months ago by Vimal,1,"Very poor experience .I have recently purchased their nyx model from Aditya motors Varanasi ,up .May be he delivered us a defective piece not even 4 months had passed and I renewed almost each every part of it as every parts got damaged on weekly basis, dealer told us that there is no warranty on it. Uncomfortable seats. Very less mileage have written many emails to the company but no replies ,not receiving customer care phone calls also .Even their gift vouchers are also already redeemed one .I will suggest not to buy their any model because in future they are not going to help you in any way."
Waste of hard earned money,10 months ago by Akshay Rajendra Mishra,1,"1) Very bad experience while buying something else shown on website regarding offer and when you visit showroom they don't know what we are talking about. 2) Riding experience is totally worst. Everything is made up of plastic and which is of worst quality. Within few months many noises will arise and lock problem which I had to change within 2 months by paying 1200 rs.3) Looks is not so good compared to petrol bikes and performance is worst. You buy a bike to save money but actually you should have invested in a petrol bike because parts of this bike is costly.4) Servicing and maintenance is always ready. As soon as you reach the showroom they will say some parts are broken which is not in warranty and ask you to pay, costly to maintain this bike. 5) pros I haven't seen any bike like this. My hard earned money I lost like stupid and I never recommend any one to take this bike."
Hero flash the best ev scooter.,1 year ago by Oommen Thomas,5,"I have completed 1020 km's on this bike.100 km's plus per charge is again and again checked and found correct. The odometer always gives a 10 percent less reading than actual. I have taken that also into account in 100 km's range. Hero electric lite is the best ev scooter in India, for the same price, and specifications. Go for this scooter to beat the petrol price and save loads of money. I have no issues in running this scooter. I recommend buyers should read a lot on lithium ion batteries and care of them for excellent range."
Awesome hero flash the petrol buster.,1 year ago by Oommen Thomas,5,"Awesome performance. I get 100 km's range with full charge. But I use it for 60 to 70 km's range only. Charging is then for two hours only. The best e bike in India. One charge is less than 1 unit. It's the cheapest mode of transport. Cost of 70 km's ride is approx. 8 rupees, or 10 paisa per km's. The bike needs disc brakes."
Awesome hero flash the petrol buster.,1 year ago by Oommen Thomas,5,"Awesome bike. I bought the hero flash from e galaxy showroom in pcmc. The sale and service personal are very helpful. I get a range of 100 km's now after riding 750 km's. I don't use the full 100 km's. I charge after every 60 to 70 km's. Charging takes just 2 hour's plus. That's because a lithium ion battery should not be charged 100 percent and should not be drained completely. I let the bike roll as much as it can and I use the throttle sparingly. Look wise the bike has a lovely cute look. I love it. Till now no maintenance. At 100 km's approx. per charge, I will get back my investment in maximum 1 year. I use under 1 unit of electricity per charge. So it's just 10 rupees for 100 km's. Or 10 paisa per km. Braking is an area the company should improve by giving disc brakes both front and rear."
Service and maintenance is very expansive.,1 year ago by Venkat,2,"Service and maintenance- even a small fix for breaks can only be fixed by hero electric showroom. Because parts are not available in open market, other mechanics are scared to touch these vehicles. And showrooms charge too much of price for even a small fix. Mechanics at Vijayawada service center are very rude as we are completely depended on them for fixing it."
Do I regret buying it for daily use.,1 year ago by Yashwanth,5,"I bought it in Hyderabad, When I was buying it they promised me of 50 km range but I got around 40. Still good. When I bought it home it was very silent and felt like a new experience .I don't know why but I got so much excited for that . One of the main reasons I bought that I don't need registration for that and I also don't need insurance and all that stuff. It's like ex showroom price is on road price .It once got stopped and didn't give warning but luckily I was near my home so I charged it . Well it was my fault that I didn't charge it in 7 days . So it was great and I felt great and I clearly don't regret buying that."
Very economical scooty,1 year ago by Parvesh Kumar,4,"It was easily available in market. I usually drive this bike and really love the ride. It is very attractive and light weight.

Speed 35 to 40 but its ok mileage 40 to 48 not bad one time charge you can drive 40 to 48 kilometre. Its cheap if we compare to petrol bikes just charge and drive, if anyone want to buy that's good for home only not for work."
Suitability riding of electric bike,1 year ago by G Garai,4,1. When i bought this bike it was high value but now this bike is economical.2. Seat is low for man but it is comfortable for women.3. Color of bike is very nice but height of seat is low.4. Servicing of this bike is done well except tube repair is very difficult because a pin is inserted into the tyre then tube is difficult to open for rear wheel . If tyre of rear wheel is solid then it is very good. Motor of rear wheel works difficult to repair.Pros: it is light in weight.Parts are light in weight.Height of this car is convenient for women.Cons: it runs sightly.Parts of this bike is not so strong.Seat of this bike is low height for man.Tyre of rear wheel is not so  solid as it necessary.
Spares are not worthy,1 year ago by Bhargav,1,"My optima giving half mileage of what promised by company with in 2 months.When i asked dealer he said first you got 3 years warranty. But now he said we don't keep batteries as spares. It cost 5000 rupees to ship your batteries to company and takes minimum 3 months . And more over you have to bare other charges if problem won't find by company.  When i called customer service, they gave me rm number, unfortunately they revealed secrets that they don't manufacturer any product like batteries and spares and body parts and body. They only buy every peace. So they don't have any technology to test and improve the batteries."
Flash exposed!!,1 year ago by Priyanshu Luhar,4,Buying experience was like a champ...It's good for teenagers with no licence and for not over speeding..The suspensions were really appreciated by me but the acceleration will decrease over time..The trunk is really tiny ..You'll need to buy a special helmet to fit in the trunk ..And one last thing read the manual carefully even for once...Thanks

Flash for a near-zero running cost!,2 years ago by Dr S John Bosco,4,"I am intrigued by the smooth, silent and efficient test ride of the flash hero electric vehicle. It was an astonishing experience for me to note that the vehicle fell silent and in stand-by mode at the signal till i accelerated... And the pick up was immediate! an ideal machine for in-town move-abouts. Your ads could be more aggressive. People could be weaned away from the false idea of meaningless speed,  wastage of power and money - and the consequent inevitable 'eco-pollutions'...It will be wonderful if its range per charge could be enhanced. I have some innovative ideas for the same. I would be happy to offer my experience & expertise to conduct/ guide some projects in this regard for the company. Kindly contact me in this regard if you think it would be useful..."
All about flash lead model how to maintain an,2 years ago by Mohammed Siddiq,3,"I bought this bike(lead) in june 2019 at 41,000(maybe costlier than now)it is good in looking but it's body is totally plastic. According to me it can't handle more than 130-150 kg of weight for the speed. If you are buying then be careful while driving, i met with an small accident and the condition of the bike was worst due to its plastic body. And one more thing it takes around 8-9 hrs for charging and last till just 30-45 km(not more than that according to me). When it was new there was no footrest for keeping legs but now may be company is allowing.Well it's maintenance is not that hard just to charge and keep it clean. But i recommend to take it to service every 2-3 months because it may cause some break issues. Otherwise this bike is amazing and you will be feeling happy to drive this."
flashing bike,9 months ago by Deepanshu Jain,1,"We purchased hero electric flash from Jindal motors, Khandwa. This dealer is good and best in service but Hero Elecric suddenly changed their dealer.

E-scooty,5 months ago by Satyam Dwivedi,5,I had taken a ride of this ebike in gorakhpur. It's run very smoothly and well. I think a best scooty in this price is unvalued. May be able to afford this is a dream for me and many younger like me. Look is attractive and performance is also good. Serving and maintenance services are quite easy. Biggest problem is not to rate of fuel and cons is build quality material.

Very pathetic experience. 6.30 pm i have taken delivery from show room on 27th Jan 2022  , at 6.45 pm console light, indicator and head light was not working. Informed dhanya motors and they sent mechanic very next day. And resolved the issue. As per them it was resolved. The moment their mechanic  left the house , issue started again. Used the vehicle for 3 days with out light and indicator due to urgency. Informed dhanya motor again to rectify , they have taken back the vehicle to check.  As per them the issue was due to loose connection and they want me to pick up the bike from work shop..... Why should i pick up the bike from their  work shop? They are not sure whether issue has been addressed or not. They want me to check and take.  I said no... Last 3 days it is lying in the show room. Never purchase this vehicle, if you want o purchase never in dhanya motor. Pathetic response from the team. I have made big blunder"

In case of performance, I would to say this is only used for domestic purpose. it may run 90 km on a single charge if it is driven in 15-18 km/h speed limit.

Look wise it is also very stylist , you can also show off certain times as well. The maintainable cost of this scooter is very low and the parts are easily available in the showroom with low servicing fee. Over all it’s the value for money deal There is no such thing which i dislike about this scooter But one thing i would say is the headlight can be more bright as i feel it is less bright."

Hero is hero,3 years ago by Ravindra Salunkhe,5,"Hero is hero, Hero is the world's leading motorcycle company.I like it. The flash's look is certainly beautiful.Being comfortable due to excessive storage, it is easy to keep the luggage, because of not being overweight, it is easy for women to run the elderly.And the fact is that since the rate of petrol is increasing day by day, the electronic bike is a newcomer."

Learnt the hard way,1 year ago by Anthony Lopes,3,"I purchased the okinawa praise the moment it was launched  only because i like to help  in whatever little way to save the environment.I own electric car revai, i use solar lighting  and also solar water heating.Anyway i paid through my nose for the praise 86500 and in just two months the controller failed.Then a month later  the mcb failed and they have replaced the mcb twice.The servicing of the scooter takes a minimum 5 to 6 days.The hooter alarm  has failed and they have permanently disconnected it as they are fed up of listening to complaints and that too within a year.Now the scooter is one point five years and the front shock absorbers have failed  in fact they had failed within one year but they could not get spare parts from the company and  i had to wait till now and now i have to pay .The rear brakes have failed they say and have gone rusty and they have to replace the entire assembly.They have  raised a bill of 5600 rupees  and can you imagine this  amount for a one point five year old scooter repairs/servicing."
Worst vehicle or i should say company,1 year ago by Devendra,1,"I purchased this vehicle from vidhi motors, jamul,  bhilai , cg. This is the worst vehicle I've ever ride. The company always ignores customers problems and don't do anything to resolve it. The showroom peoples are also very cheap people don't do anything on time of servicing but charge unnecessarily for cables, cord, unknown parts, etc. They lie to me at the time of buying the vehicle that it'll give the range of 150+ kms. ,but now after I've done my vehicle's 5th servicing the range(mileage) comes down to 80kms. I don't know what they do in servicing, asking us to leave the vehicle for 3-4 days resolve no problem ,but charge for servicing like they did a great work. Such a bastard people..  This vehicle or i should say company is pure waste of money and time.  At last i request people if they are thinking of buying an electric bike or scooter, please go for any other company but not for this because they'll cheat you till the world's end..."

Big brand but worst product as compared to an,2 years ago by Prashant Rout,1,"I had purchased from bhagabat motors, bhubaneswar on nov 2018 the lead acid model. 1) the show room puts mixing with two different brand batteries. 2) after 1 year it runs only 12000kms and battery gone. Lead acid battery cost 36000/-  without warranty, but not available. 3) when you fully open the seat, it touches the horn switch and it sounds. Speedometer and odometer both are fake, showing higher value. 4) my back disk break, the rotor rubbing with break pads, which is a manufacturing defect, but the show room engineer ignore the issue. 5) it is so heavier that, unable to put with the double stand. Finally i can say you may go with electric vehicles but not from okinawa."

Pathetic dealer in Pune,2 years ago by Piyush Shah,1,The dealers are poorly equipped with servicing training and they don't have spares. My charger stopped working since the last 10 days and the dealers don't have spares to provide it to customers. My bike is lying idle since 10 days. Usb is fitted on the exterior of the bike it gets spoilt in the rains and no spares to fix it again. I bought it from greenlife pune baner the dealers is pathetic on all fronts.
My overall review and experience on using thi,2 years ago by Priyanka Joseph,1,"Hi,I have been using this bike for 8 months.I use it daily for going to office approximately 45 kms. In 8 months more than 3 times the indicator,front light and horn stopped working and the servicing also is very bad,every time they change it,it works for a month again it stops working.As they have mentioned in the scooter details it goes for 70 kms on full charge but it’s not true. It goes 50 kms maximum. Taking doubles is impossible in the vehicle because it goes very slowly and the rider feels heavy while riding.Taking doubles for long distance is impossible.I have had horrible experience like the vehicle goes off all of a sudden because the battery cannot take more weight. I recommend you all to think wisely before buying this scooter.Thank you."
Okinawa ridge!!! very poor don't buy,2 years ago by Babu,1,"Don’t buy okinawa ,it s my personal  opinions because i am owner of okinawa ridge (licenced type) what all the specification they are telling is wrong. They as telling 70 km mileage @ 55 km speed. Its all wrong .The  speed 55 km what they are mentioning in the meter is originally 50 only( meter is also wrong) i was getting initially 55-60km mileage only  ( in all the mode eco/sort..But they are saying 70 km).I bought the vehicle 14-08-2018, after 3 months my mileage is going down to 40-45 km even after the service also.At the end of the six months battery down and the mileage reduce to 20-25( means one full charge i am getting only 25 km.)i complaint to the dealer rapid motor in kerala,they change one battery only( but i am sure that 2-3 batteries are weak. They discharged and charged again Even changed the battery also i am getting only 40 km mileage !!!! ( instead of 60-70 what they are telling). When its complete one year and 3 months suddenly the battery done and i am getting only 10-15 km( believe it!!! it is true!!!!) when i approach the dealer rapid motors kerala thrissur, they denied to change the batteries  because the warranty is over!!!! now i am running my okinawa with the mileage of 15-20 only!!!! that means…if you buy okinwa at rs 60000 you should keep 15000 after one year for weak batteries…..(my all green thoughts has changed…"
Bad scooty. Don't dare to buy it,2 years ago by Ravi Singh,1,I paid 81000 on road and was happy in paying that amount until reality stuck. Within a month of usage it started giving problems. And now a visit to service center happens every 2 weeks. I feel really low quality components are used to build this bike and it has not gone through any quality checks. Please don't buy it. You'll waste your money and have an additional headache while driving it.
My suggestion on this stupid bike,2 years ago by Manjunath,1,This is stupid bike. Till good you don't understand the issue. One start getting troubles you will never expect troubles.

Very bad,9 months ago by Hitesh Kumar,1,After sales service is very bad. No one takes responsibility in service center. My bike is in service since 2 months but no positive or responsible reply from service center. Very bad experience of service. No one pickup call in service center. Please guys don't take bike of this company. Their intention is only to sell.
Worst after sales service,2 months ago by Pratik Papde,1,"Worst after-sales service. If your bike gets malfunctioned then consider that your bike will take at least a month.. The same happened to me, they don't have spare parts which is the worst part. Contacted customer care service.. No response.. Contacted regional officer of theirs.. Just gave false hope.. Same condition. Made contact every day, every day they said the part which is malfunctioned they are not getting their spare, everyday new reason was told. It's been more than 12 days... Still the same... Without bike"
Sigmatel scooters. Cheap chinese scooter rebr,4 months ago by Sam,1,"This might be a bit long.Okinawa is the china set for scooter. They should rebrand themselves as sigmatel.This is a cheap chinese scooter rebranded as indian, the charger and internals are written in chinese. Why tell lies, if it's made in china say so, why the subterfuge. It's most likely manufactured in china and assembled in India. This is like old tech 2014-15 hero electric kind of scooter. So much for make in India and boycott china. Weak plastic body is see-through in sunlight, poor headlight visibility is barely 10 meter in dark it's dangerous to ride this as potholes or people aren't visible. The disk brakes are bad and it's constantly rubbing eating battery and brake pads. Lead acid battery lasts 6000kms only costs 30k to replace, lithium ion battery is also very bad, they are using old lithium cells which fail after the warranty is over. The service center is the worst, most of the time they are closed, and they get commission for servicing the scooter by tearing out the coupons and sending them to okinawa without actually servicing any scooter. Okinawa you're cheating and also getting cheated. They are using children as mechanic that is not just unethical but also illegal as they are working with 70 volts dc which is dangerous. No warranty or repair possible because dealers only sell it and don't know how to service it. The company doesn't care for its image as it's only cares about selling more and more. Mr okinawa is a fool if he thinks he'll get rich by doing this . Tighten up your ship sir.  Here's some business advice from a loser to an idiot, how does hero exist today? huh? is it because of its amazing engineering? exquisite build quality, best in class performance? nope none of those. Hero or formerly hero Honda was and is successful because it could be fixed easily and readily even though they made crap, that crap was cheap crap and that cheap crap can be easily fixed by buying some cheap crap and replacing the crapped crap part and you're good to go on your crappy bike on the crappy road to the other crappy part of this crappy country. They didn't just sell the bikes and bolted. They made service center everywhere. Even in the craphole town I call home there are 3 hero showrooms nearby and one Honda showroom but you Mr. okinawa sold about 10-15 scooters here then shut shop and went abracadabra. I can't get my front brake pads replaced so i now await my death or someone else's death because i can't have front brakes anymore. Also no rear brake warning light because life is short so okinawa policy is to make it even shorter unlike people from okinawa who live very long lives, yes I've read your bullshit business man bites from various auto media outlets. If  Mr. okinawa wants to remain in the market it'll have to improve its manners and mindset of providing proper after sales service and spares and repair, make battery station etc or okinawa will be nothing but a sigmatel, china set owners will recognize that name. Service center is denying warranty for rear brake light switch and saying i will have to fix it elsewhere. How indian government is allowing such malpractice against consumer and buyers is appalling. The hub motor is weak and only capable upto 50 km/h max. But the speedo shows 70 plus hilarious. The motor bearings used are so cheap that it got bent during running and now the wheel wobbles and rubs with the disc brake pads.Fake speedometer and odometer shows exaggerated numbers.Charging the lead acid battery takes 7 hours minimum. The lithium also takes surprisingly long about 4-5 hrs.Battery capacity meter is also wrong doesn't show range left or energy left. There is no bms so it can go boom during charging and running. There's no battery or motor cooling so they overheat during use. Battery meter just shows 5 bars which shows full when standing and drinks completely when running. Suspension is un-adjustable and extremely poor, front is too soft and sags completely on sitting one person and rear is too hard and has very low travel. The scooter weighs 170kg feels like handling a royal enfield on cycle tyres. The handle wobbles dangerously in speeds above 40kph on uneven roads.  they are asking 90k plus for this crap. I lost more money on battery than saving on petrol. If you want to throw away money buy this. After owning this scooter for 2 years i feel like a sigmatel china set owner."
I like to burn it with petrol.,4 months ago by Ankit Saini,1,"I like to burn it with petrol. Okinawa's quality is absolutely bad. And its distributors do not even talk beyond their office hours. I think the customer is crazy.. I am very worried about this. Okinawa's service is also bad. Now what to do if you do like that. How does a person take it to drive. .I do not take this, i say this. I have become mad twice in 15 days."

Hub motor ev only for good & smooth roads & r,6 months ago by Sathiyendran,3,"1.Bought okinawa praise pro at 87k on full cash payment.2.Riding comfort is very low, need to keep your leg in height position. Not good suspension.3.Look and is very good, performance is medium. Maximum speed is 55 km/h only but it will show 70 in odometer.4.Not much services required, minimum level of maintenance cost if you use as a smooth riding. For rough riding (includes road condition) this ev is not recommended.5.Saving bit amount of fuel cost but need to plan your trips and battery charging time accordingly.If your road is not good then do not buy this hub motor type of ev bikes, motor will get damaged easily. There is no better solution in service center as well as company."
Okinawa praise review,6 months ago by Syed Asad,1,"I had bought the Okinawa praise model in January 2019 which was given to me by the dealer for 82000. From this it is known that the company has no control over the dealer. Dealers can rob the customer as much as they want from their mind. Since then the mileage of the bike was not as much as it is told. If we are 10 km. When the bike is running, its meter shows 13 to 14 km and the bike does not give an average of more than 100 km.Even after showing all these faults, the dealer did not do any solution. After that, told the company all the problems on the phone and also did email but the company also did not give any response. Tired of all this, i filed my complaint with the district consumer forum Aurangabad whose number is ( cc/606/2019)And wow i won my case. And now my complaint state consumer forum Aurangabad is here and i am sure that the forum will understand my grievance and resolve it. If anyone has such a problem like me, then he should contact me, I will definitely help. Unless we go to the customer dispute forum, the company will not know about the customer's grievance.You can make your own complaint in the customer disputes redressal forum. And it doesn't seem like any charge is completely free. If anyone needs any information, then tell me, mail me and I shall give full help to the troubled customer like myself and will give all the information even further.."
Very poor service,7 months ago by Gopal,1,"Returned to the showroom to get the bike serviced. Got the same answer, there was no staff for the service, and told to come after 2 days.

Opinion,4 years ago by Baldev Singh,5,
Okinawa think before you buy,9 months ago by Yatin,3,In gujarat only high speed moped is available with state gov. Subsidy of 19000 Rs per bike.Price around 75000 Rs after subsidy.Major problem with speedometer.It shows 65-70 km/h but in actual conditions it's 55 km/h.Another problem riding is the kilometre showing  80 km but in actual it's only 60 km. Else lithium iron battery is good. 2.30 hour for fully charge. You can go for city rides.
Fight against corruption,9 months ago by Somashekar,1,"lease make a group on whatsapp, Whoever needs to lodge a complaint against okinawa company for their faults. The scooty shows 80 kms run when actually its 100 kms. Just raise a complaint on consumer forum."
Ev market is a roller coaster ride in my coun,10 months ago by Anthony Lopes,1,My advice is do not buy until we have an effective judicial accountability system in place so as to protect consumers from this turncoat manufacturers as they bribe the politicians and the media and hype the product and entice the gullible Indian customer to buy and then when the product fails there is nowhere to go for the consumer and these consumer courts are in effective as the lawyers fix matters and you are left in the lurch.
"Not worth for money, all things are worst qua",1 year ago by Siruraja,1,"Fake speedometer, fake mileage calculator everything is fake. I bought this bike and change the battery (gel battery, Okinawa product) after driving for 7500 km. The battery cost is 35k. So think before you buy.

Never buy Okinawa scooters.,1 year ago by Kamal Bhandari,1,"In the early days it seemed that buying Okinawa is a good decision, but if you are happy with the amount of petrol saved during the year, more than you get together. When you are recommended a new battery and the battery costs just 32000. The 60000 on-road scooter has a 32000 battery, awesome. Never buy these scooters."
Okinawa praise is soo good and efficiently ve,1 year ago by Manoj Singh Bhadoria,5,"I bought my okinawa praise in 2018, starting it delivered 150-170 km/charge, after one it delivered 130-120 km/charge and now it delivery is about 90-110 km/charge and it take dead to full charging about 7-8hr(5-6 unit electric).

Hmmm last i tell that  all over it good and efficiently vehicle for me,Thanks to okinawa"
Pros and Cons,1 year ago by Vikash Kushwaha,3,"I found equal merits and demerits in Okinawa Praise Pro.Pros:- -Front Space-Good pickup-Satisfactory speed ( Actual 55-60)-Range- Never expect more than 80km (actual) in any case.-Comfortable seating-Full charge timing:- Never took more than 3.5 hrs. Cons:--Worst part of okinawa scooters are Speedometer or Odometer ( It shows 10km more than actual speed and consequently it counts the trip kilometres.2. There are two horn switch. None of the switch loaction is as per your thumb. 3. Range could be better as I was expected 100km (actual)  4. Central Government Subsidy looks like Scam. Company assured that they have reduced those subsidy from Ex-show room as shown on the website. Thus, cost of the Model Praise Pro is approx 90k in Delhi. This is little expensive as compared.Hope it may help."
Waste of money,4 years ago by Manoj,1,"Guys, Once ride the bike on slope with 2 persons. As my praise can't even get on the slope with single person. It's waste of money.

Its a best in electric bikes with a good mile,3 years ago by Yogesh Tandel,5,It's is comparing to the other bike in pricing it is well good. Because within single charge we could ride at least 200 km. It's a best bike in electric bikes & even with good looks & sporty looks. We should check time to time & keep take care of battery life. I'm really very very happy such a nice bike.

1 time ride experience,4 years ago by Arpan Mukherjee,5,"this scooty have Matt colour finish it's headlamp and body frame takes a sporty look but body graphics not likeable , suspension is good from any scooter suspension .you all know that features key less entry , back gear(like back gear but not back gear just motor gave you minimum power to go back) , when your scooters side stand down scooter can't on ,EBS system ( not like abs but it's breaking system controlled bye electric system) overall it's very good this scooty get full charge at 7 hr scooters tubeless tyres and bigger wheels. this scooters have rear and front disc  brake but front disc   very very big and strong, this disc break give you strong breaking .its have two horns in two handle and horn is not good , Handling is very good. but service centres not available in our city but it's servicing was dun in hero showroom and the owner tell me the servicing cost will less than petrol scooters around 100 or 200 maybe .lead acid battery will stable for 2 yr . this scooter I ride 15 or 16 km and I falls in love of this scooter and will get of this scooters lithium ion model bcz lithium ion stable 5000 charging circles and to low weight from led acid battery this battery in one time  full charge give 200 kmc  lead acid model not gave 160 kmc in economic mode."
Okinawa e-bike,4 years ago by Vikas Verma,4,"Riding is awesome, very comfortable easy driving, good performance, worth of money.. I strongly recommend to buy this vehicle.It is pollution free and charging time is 5 to 6 hours. Extremely low maintenance cost. Very helpful in day to day (local) work. I will definitely prefer this e-bike over my petrol bike to save environment and running cost."
My experience for okinawa,2 years ago by Arvind Kumar,1,I am happy to buy this scooter . My daily running 50 km .In 10 months 10000 km runs.All thing is good.Low maintenance .I have think about battery life.Is it good or not .If it requires with in 20000 km then not benefits for me .More than 20000 is average .More than 30000 beneficial.Riding experience is good but not suitable for long distance.
Very nice scooter much better than activa,4 years ago by Vikas Gogawat,5,"Lovely scooter had a great ride but only did 125kms on single charge hope in future when lithium battery comes, it will do 170-200kms, i got top speed 55kmph, on turbo 65khph but only for 20 sec, pillion rider footrest not so comfortable company needs to work on it's design or any alternate. Very good support from the company as motor was locked once, company personal came all the way to sort out the issue."
After using the okniwa praise after one month,4 years ago by Imran Khan,3,"It’s really good but after sale services is not good.It doesn’t clime 200km only 150kms. Speed is only 60kms/h,horn is on wrong direction.Its takes nearly 7 hours to take full charge.Looks of bike is awesome but the charging time is too long.Company should provide lithium battery instead of lead acid battery.According to my opinion the price of the scooter is high, onroad price of the scooter is 73k. I don’t know what will be price of the new battery if gone.If it is 15k worth-able, if it is more 15k waste to buy it."

Review,3 years ago by Ashwini Kudure,1,Service is worst.I suggest to avoid this purchase.Battery life is not at all good and company does not have any inventory.Avoid it. Don't buy it.Chassis are broken it's very shocking.So called alloy wheels are broken in run.One if worst battery life.Not at all beneficial.Company is not all trust worthy.
Review,3 years ago by V Muthusamy,2,"Odometer is showing higher speed than actual speed. Maximum speed is 55km against company claim of 75km. Maximum mileage per charge is 100km to 110km against company claim of 175 km. Not suitable for ride in the night, since the headlights are very poor. Distance between handle to seat is too lengthy comparing with activa or access, it gives pain to hand, in the long drive ie above 20kms. Horn and light switch are placed different places compared with other scooters, so we have to struggle in the initial days. Seat length is comparatively less. Foot stand is in high position."

Not happy,3 years ago by Manish,3,It's good but main problems related to maintenance. Whenever problems in bike no service available easily so bike should be take place on your risk two time i have facing this problem it's take 5 to 7 days to repair also 1 battery changed in two month battery capacity weak in two month it's gives 100km in single charge.
Such a worst,2 years ago by Devendra Sinha,1,"This scooter is not even worth of it's price of 76500, it has all this problems...1. Only goes 100-120 kms.2. Speedometer is full fake showing 72 km/h top speed but real gps speed is only 52-53km/h..3. Battery charge indicator is also useless never ever shows correctly. 4. Very very uncomfortable seat and riding posture.5. Useless headlights led is just fake not go even 20 meters of distance.. Hard to ride at night.6. It's weight is terribly 170kg+ and vibrates alot at any potholes or speed breakers.I haven't yet seen any of the good quality in this scooter...I'll never suggest anyone to buy it... Its useless and money wasting scooter.."
No value for money,3 years ago by Vijay Shinde,1,"Ride is bumpy like riding camel.175 km per charge is false. It seems  testing done on machine not on road.Sitting arrangement for driver is worst.  Adaptation of all controls like horn , blinker is worst.Suspension is worst experience just line riding bicycle. Loss of money. Worst experience.Look is good and performance is worst. I am worried for battery life."
No1 electric vehicle in india,3 years ago by Ramesh Pradhan,5,"After taking test ride of hero and tunwal i felt okinawa praise was better than all those. Actually i wanted to buy a good looking scooter with good mileage and non of them are providing the same except okinawa praise.1. Buying experience:I bought the vehicle from sai enterprises, dhalapathar,khurda,odisha. Dealer was very helpful and was very straight forward in mentioning all the pros and cons. The total amount i paid was rs76000 for double disc brake one. 2. Riding experience:To be honest for 1-2 days i felt very awkward while driving bcoz of soundless and then finally loved it. On bumpy rides its not giving very much comfortable ride experience but in main road it's giving fine experience. I ride it daily for 80kms. Braking system is amazing with double disc.3. Details about looks & performance:I bought the glossy purpule colour and it looks amazingly well and many people always states and asks me about the vehicle mostly bcoz it's very eye catching.Charging time is actually 8-9 hours and in single charge it's giving 140kms. I have tested it and in manual also it's written maximum 150kms , so maybe 200km is for lithium version.4. Service & maintenance: Haha actually i have not gone a single time for any service but yes availed the free service by them twice , just battery rotation and few adjustments.Maintenance is actually zero in it and i'm saving a lot of fuel cost.5. Pros and cons:Pros: saves me daily rs100 and early rs36000 , in two years i will get my money back by this which is amazing.In single charge goes for 140kms with speed of 60kms that is my speed .Zero maintenance and no need to visit service centre and no need to change engine oil like that.Look is classy and with keyless start and locking and theft protection including mobile charging it's really good.Only takes 3 unit of electricity that is rs10 for my home metre. Cons : suspension not very good on bumpy roads."
Okinawa  struggling,3 years ago by Hari,1,"Worst experience, at initially i was excited to buy a drove this electric bike as a eco friendly person.However , come to personal experience The build quality of bike is poor.Cons: Will start from front to rear of bike 1) head lights of bike are like a mobile screen light at high beam, at low beam no need to say.2)handle will shake on riding, due to it's non rigidity. This will not affect more but whenever we drive on rough road it would. May it cause accident if you don't drive care fully.3) come to ignition switch (power the motor) the build quality of switches are very poor. Horn switch was damaged in first week. But luckily it have two switches. These switches are bit different we cannot adapt initially to press because it's position it's a different matter.4)major part of bike is battery backup Company mentioned it will go until 150-200 km. Thats absolutely false. May they tested on treadmillIn reality it can go only 80-100 km. With a single person. If you rode dual on bike it's comes under 85km *(initially i tested). Depends on roads. But now it's giving me only  Guarantee on batteries would be 1 year.The company of batteries are not a good one..4) this is the bad experience , after drove Later on front alloy wheel was broke-in in it's spokes and pivot joint where bike will contact with tire.This is the worst one i experienced. Virtually alloy wheels won't break it self. But here it's happen . Roughly my weight would be Let's imagine if a person with 70- 80 kg i shipped my bike in a trolley to show room in the middle of the road. I have snap shots of this.5) speedo meter will cheat you, it would showing 10km extra ex: if you are on a speed of 50 it will show 60. Again trapping by company .It won't go greater than 60 - 65 on a flat road and down slope. If it is a height slope it will go under 30 -356) front disk break is attractive but don't expect performance .I rarely used that break because of it's breaking mechanism. It won't control bike speed even if you on 20km speed 7)parts of the bike loosely coupled, never know which part will go off on running bike.8) seating experience is worst if you drove 50 km you will get tired due to it's height of the foot rest Pros:There is not much more 1) no fuel 2) less running cost (maintenance).3)eco friendly.4) bike will easily pull two persons As a electric engineer i have lot of to say but this is enough to understand about this bike Buy electric bikes but not from okinawa ."
over all good for pocket and environment,3 years ago by Anand Singh,4,Good:- once charge give 120kms (single person)very sufficient for pocket as per petrol bike.large spacebreaking control awesome bcz its dual disclow cost service charge almost 200 to 300.Bad:- Company claimed 170-200 km/per charge but actual milage is only 120km/per charge max.charging time almost 10hrs not 6 to 8 hrs.speed meter not actual show kmph.very very heavy weight.

Okinawa vashi showroom is bad and not honest,1 year ago by Ganesh Chachar,2,"Okinawa vashi sale &  service showroom is not proper... Local battery supplier without warranty and service.. Not promoting Okinawa original parts and batteries.. I have purchased it on 26 aug. 2020 battery for rs.31000/- till today from day one i have been complaint for battery, battery is faulty, after 2 kms. Is showing charging bar on display only 2 bar.. I have been quested so many time to replace same..Yes'day my daughter got accident due to Okinawa scooty, please Don't allow authorized dealer to supply duplicate components to customer."
Much ado about nothing,1 year ago by Chat Tree Atul,1,Servicing &maintenance issues.Bike giving problems after two yrs(5600km).No support available to address the issue.Need to change to lithium ion battery as the installed vrla battery set (72v 48ah) seem to get exhausted too quickly after a long recharge.Looking for a service provider as the outlet here at gandhidham kutch is closed past two months.
Poor performance failing frequently no spares,1 year ago by Sudesh,1,"My nightmare started the day I purchased my scooter.. Initially when I complained of low range & screeching sound I was told that you are driving. Electric vehicle for first time so this problem is arising. and one was concerned even to check the vehicle. Then on second charge time I found the battery socket was broken .I was told it will be repaired n no replacement of battery for same. Then intermittently the scooter started giving problems. Most of the times it stopped running. The dealers don’t have spares & skilled technicians to do the trouble shooting. I had even complained at the okinawa company for the problem ,they assigned a engineer who was least bothered even to see what is the issue and just asked the technician to check. Till date the vehicle still fails they don’t have a solution for same. I purchased the vehicle from auto z showroom in dombivli, If you call company customer care they are least bothered. Engineers if he is on a vacation nothing can be done is a simple answer from them. Think twice before buying."
Needs stable performance,2 years ago by Suhayl,2,"I have bought the okinawa praise 1.5 yr back. The mileage which they promised, while i bought was 140km per charge, if it is sport mode..120 km.. I never saw the promised mileage.. In reality the mileage would be 110 economic mode and 90 sport mode. When i complained about the mileage, initially they said, the battery needs atleast 10 cycles of charge, to give full mileage.. It almost went 100 cycles now.. There is no change in the mileage.. And one more thing, they promised is till 4 yr there will not be any performance drop. After 1.5 yr itself, i see drop in my mileage, despite regular service. .I really lost the trust in the okinawa scooters.. From the performance perspective..First 40 km of drive is comfortable..After that the speed performance gradually decreases.. I don't really recommend.. It needs lot of improvements.. I think..For a good electric bike..We need to wait for some more years.."
Worst services,1 week ago by Shubham,1,"I'm from satara. Having a problem with your one-month repairing policy. Whenever my scooter has problems such as sensors, battery, or any of your issues with dealer issues. Why do I have to leave my vehicle there for the month? After the month also I'm not getting my vehicle why this is happening to me it's a 3rd time and I don't have any of the authority to see what is the process in which my request of that issue is going on. On the last 6th of April, I submitted my vehicle but there is not my vehicle is ready. How can Okinawa users can survive through this condition...? I can see the future of this vehicle only when it is a secondary vehicle. Because of this 1 month's policy, I'm not able to consider this vehicle as a primary vehicle. This is the 14th of may and still, I'm hoping to give me my vehicle... Please consider my opinion and help me out because I'm also unable to reach your customer care."

Dealer's staff is very rude and not qualified to service the vehicle. When we approach dealer for service issues they will not clear the problem and instead there will be several other problems after i got the vehicle from them. Totally waste. Please do not waste your money company did not change service technicians even after complaining. Dealer manages with unskilled and rude staff. Please in hyderabad please avoid this vehicle and most importantly this dealer in kondapur"

Ultimate city scooter,1 year ago by Prathith,5,"The pure EV dealers are very kind and polite and clarified all my questions. The buying experience was ultra smooth and they processed our order very quickly. Even same day delivery is available. The ride on this vehicle is very comfortable. I travel 50 km's daily in heavy traffic condition in Bengaluru. This vehicle is value for money. Running cost is lowest among its competitors. It is very suitable for daily city commuting. The vehicle has good looks and design and has all the basic feature that a 2 wheeler must have. One more myth about e vehicles is that it will not be able to climb steep roads. But I have tested in steep roads and while coming out of steep basement exit. Even though vehicle was stopped at the mid of climb, it managed to climb fully without any hassle. This scooter can do anything that a 110 cc scooter can do. But do keep in mind the battery charge level to avoid range anxiety. Some dealers are offering to exchange with petrol vehicles. I recommend to buy this vehicle if you have to travel within the city traffic. The dealer and the company both are oriented towards customer satisfaction. They respond to your requests immediately. This quality of the company is lacking among its competitors. Cons: The scooter's seat is small. Hopefully they will upgrade it in the next version The placement of switches should be redesigned. No usb charging port"

Build quality is super bad and the parts get,2 months ago by Manjunath,2,"It has been 6 months since i bought this vehicle. There are several problems occurring since past 2 months and they are as follows.1) the charger stopped working after 15 days from the date of purchase. Thankfully they replaced it.2) the brake sensor deteriorated very quickly. Acceleration would not work and it would stop in the middle of the road sometimes. They charged rs.200 for the sensor.3) after 1st service, the display stopped working. They fixed it.4) after 2nd service, the horn went off and they charged rs.250 for fixing it. 5) indicator and head light switch is of very low quality.  I have got them changed twice till now.6) instead of rubber mat, plastic mat is provided which causes slips.7) swing arm makes cranking noises while moving on the road. Even the brakes make such noise when it is used.Overall, the build quality is super bad. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone."

Waste of time.                                                              Worst service centerNo mileage.                No top speed.
Useless cheap body and reckless service team,1 month ago by Akhila,1,I bought pure 7g and after it was a hell like experience. I bought it from gaura Kondapur and the team is not worth for even a penny. They don't know even basic details about the vehicle and their after sale service is nightmare. There will be no proper support or service and the vehicle is downgrade quality from mirrors to back support handle. Their centre stand touches every speed breaker on the road. I don't know how they missed safety standards being a indian and Hyderabad made the considerable height of bumps on the road. They charged high amount for the quality provided and zero service and support. Company should take this seriously because dealers have already spoiled the brand image(i don't say it has got some brand value). I was a fool to take my hard earned money on this cheap toy and i request everyone else not to go for this.
Pure ev review,1 month ago by Manjunath,2,"I bought pure ev in augustI bought pure ev in august 2021, the quality of vehicle is very bad, there are no proper services and no trained mechanic. Also the vehicle is under warranty and they always tell that they will get the parts from pure ev, they will never call also even from supplier. It is too pathetic. Suggest don't go for this. With 20 k or more you can go with Ather or iQube."
Not take ev. Better purchase petrol.,1 month ago by Abdul,1,Waste of money. I told 2 times in the service center regarding the handle is very tight. Then also it's not getting work.

Worst vehicle,3 months ago by Mahesh,1,i had purchased the vehicle from richmond road show room.  I had faced the below mentioned difficulties.While taking the bike they spoke very nicely but after that the service was very poor and worst.2.The vehicle is worst than any cycle. This much huge amount I have invested on this. I have not at all driven the kilometers upto 3000 km only.3. Last three - 3  times the vehicle was towed from hosur Tamilnadu and every time the charges was Rs. 3000/- * 3 times total towing charges was Rs.9000/-. Every time they will tell a nice story behind that and I have done every thing for your vehicle. While driving to hosur for only 40 kms the mileage dropped immediately. 4. Please this time I don't want to take any risk. My humble request to your company is to change the battery or take the vehicle and give some other good vehicle.
